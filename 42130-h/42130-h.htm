<h1>FOR THE HONOR OF RANDALL</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>A PERILOUS RIDE</small></h2>


<p>“What a glorious night!”</p>

<p>Tom Parsons, standing at the window of the
study which he shared with his chums, looked
across the campus of Randall College.</p>

<p>“It’s just perfect,” he went on.</p>

<p>There was no answer from the three lads who,
in various attitudes, took their ease, making more
or less of pretenses at studying.</p>

<p>“The moon,” Tom went on, “the moon is
full&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So are you&mdash;of words,” blurted out Sid Henderson,
as he leafed his trigonometry.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the finest nights&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Since nights were invented,” broke in Phil
Clinton, with a yawn. “Dry up, Tom, and let us
bone, will you?”</p>

<p>Unmoved by the scorn of his chums, the tall
lad at the casement, gazing out on the scene,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which, to do him justice, had wonderfully moved
him, continued to stand there. Then, in a quiet
voice, as though unconscious of the presence of the
others, he spoke:</p>

<p>“The moon o’er yonder hilltop rises, a silver
disk, like unto a warrior’s shield, whereon he,
from raging battle coming, is either carried upon
it, or bears it proudly as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh for cats’ sake!” fairly yelled Frank Simpson,
the Big Californian, as he had been dubbed.
He shied his book full at Tom Parsons, catching
him in the back, and bringing to a close the blank
verse our hero was spouting, with a grunt that
greatly marred it.</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows can’t appreciate anything decent!”
shot back the lad at the window. “If I
try to raise you above the level of the kindergarten
class you are in deep water. I suppose I should
have said: ‘Oh see the moon. Does the moon
see me? The moon sees me. What a pretty
moon!’ Bah! You make me tired. Here we
have the most glorious night of the winter, with
a full moon, snow on the ground to make it as
light as day, a calm, perfect night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh perfect night!” mocked Sid.</p>

<p>“Vandal!” hissed Tom.</p>

<p>“Go on! Hear Hear! Bravo!” cried Phil.
“Let the noble Senator proceed!”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of mustard!” broke in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
big lad who had tossed his book at Tom. “There’s
no use trying to do any work with this mob. I’m
going over to see Dutch Housenlager. He won’t
spout blank verse when I want to bone, and that’s
some comfort.”</p>

<p>“No, but he’ll want to get you into some horse-play,
like tying knots in Proc. Zane’s socks, or
running the flag up at half mast on the chapel,”
declared Tom. “You had much better stay here,
Frank. I’ve got something to propose.”</p>

<p>“There! I knew it!” cried Phil. “There’s a
girl in it somewhere, or Tom would never be so
poetical. Who is she, Tom? and when are you
going to propose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows are worse than the measles,”
groaned the lad who had been looking at the
moonlight. “I’m done with you. I leave you to
your fate.”</p>

<p>With a grunt of annoyance Tom turned away
from the window, kicked under the sofa the book
which Frank had thrown at him, and reached for
his cap and coat.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” asked Phil quickly, as he
turned over in the deep armchair, causing the
ancient piece of furniture to emit many a groan,
and send out a choking cloud of dust. “Whither
away, fair sir?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere, to get away from you fellows,”
grunted the displeased one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but seriously, where are you going?”
asked Frank. “Now that you’ve broken the ice,
I don’t mind admitting that I don’t care such an
awful lot for boning.”</p>

<p>Tom paused in the doorway, one arm in and
the other out of his coat.</p>

<p>“I’m going out,” he answered. “It’s too nice
to stay in. The coasting must be great on Ridge
Hill, and with this moon&mdash;say it’s a shame to
stay in! That’s what I’ve been trying to ding
into you fellows, only you wouldn’t listen. Why,
half of Randall must be out there to-night.”</p>

<p>“What about Proc. Zane?” asked Sid, referring
to the proctor, who kept watch and ward over
the college.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” answered Tom. “A lot of
the fellows went to Moses after the last lecture
and got permission to take their bobs over on the
hill. There were so many that the good old doctor
said he’d raise the rules for to-night, because
it was likely to be such a fine one. So there’s no
danger of being up on the carpet, if we get in at
any decent hour.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so at first?” demanded
Sid. “Of course we’ll go. Why didn’t you mention
it instead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought you had some poetry in you,” responded
Tom. “I tried to make you appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the beauty of the night rather than appeal to the
sordid side of your natures, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” begged Phil, with a laugh. “If
there’s any coasting, and I guess there is, we’ll be
in it. Come on, fellows, and we’ll see how our
bob does on the hill.”</p>

<p>With laughter and gay talk, now that they had
made up their minds to adopt Tom’s suggestion,
and go coasting, the four chums, than whom there
was no more devoted quartette in Randall, passed
out into the corridor. As they descended the
stairs they heard a subdued hum that told of other
students bent on the same errand, and, when they
had a glimpse of the snow-covered campus, they
beheld many dark figures hurrying along, dragging
single sleds or big bobs after them.</p>

<p>“Say, I hope no one pinches ours!” cried Tom,
and at the thought he hastened his pace toward an
out-building of the gymnasium, where the students
kept their bicycles in Summer, and their bobs in
Winter.</p>

<p>It was now Winter at Randall, a glorious Winter,
following a glorious football season. For
several years it had been the custom for the students
to indulge in coasting on a big hill about a
mile away from the college. Some of the lads
clubbed together and had built fine, big bobs, with
foot rests, carpet on the top, with immense gongs
to sound warning, and with steering wheels that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
equalled those of autos, while some had drag
brakes, to use in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The bob owned jointly by Tom Parsons, Sid
Henderson, Phil Clinton and Frank Simpson, was
one of the best in Randall. It was fifteen feet
long, and could carry quite a party. It needed
no small skill and strength to steer it, too, when
fully loaded.</p>

<p>Our friends, getting out their sled, soon found
themselves in the midst of a throng of fellow
students, all hurrying toward the hill. The four
chums had hold of the rope to haul the big bob.</p>

<p>“There are the Jersey twins,” remarked Sid,
as Jerry and Joe Jackson hurried on, dragging a
small bob.</p>

<p>“And here comes Dutch,” added Phil. “He
can ride with us, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Tom. “I say, Dutch!” he
called. “Got a sled?”</p>

<p>“No. Why should I when there are already
plenty?” “Dutch,” or otherwise Billy Housenlager,
demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” spoke Frank. “Come on, give
us a hand, and we’ll give you a ride.”</p>

<p>“I am too tired,” was the answer, “but I will
let you have the honor of pulling me,” and, with
a sigh of contentment Dutch threw himself down
on the big bob.</p>

<p>“Here! Get off, you horse!” cried Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>A loud snore was the answer. Sid started back
to roll the lazy student off, but Tom, with a wink,
indicated a better way of disposing of him. At a
signal the four students broke into a run.</p>

<p>“Ah, this beats an auto,” murmured Billy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the four swerved sharply, and the bob
turned over, spilling Dutch off, into a snow bank.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand double-dyed maledictions upon
you!” he spluttered, as he blew the snow out of
his mouth. “Just for that I’ll not ride with you.
Hold on, Jerry&mdash;Joe,” he called to the Jersey
twins, “wait for papa!”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at Dutch and his predicament,
and then the crowd of students hurried on,
our heroes among them. In a little while they
could hear distant shouts, and the clanging of bells.</p>

<p>“Some crowd on the hill,” observed Tom. “I
told you there’d be sport.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, my hearty,” agreed Phil.
“Whew! I should say there was a mob!” for by
this time they had come out on top of the long
slope that led down the country road, forming
the coasting place, known as Ridge Hill.</p>

<p>While most of the crowd consisted of students
from Randall College, there were not a few lads
and girls from the neighboring town of Haddonfield,
and the shrill voices of the lassies and the
hoarser shouts of the boys, mingled musically that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
moonlit night. The clang of bells on the bobs
was constant.</p>

<p>“Come on now, get ready!” called Tom.
“Let’s take a crowd down.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to steer?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Let Frank,” advised Sid. “He’s got the most
muscle, and he needs exercise.”</p>

<p>“I like your nerve,” retorted the Big Californian.
But he took his place at the steering wheel,
while Tom got on the rear to work the brake,
and Sid acted as bell-ringer.</p>

<p>“Get aboard!” invited Tom, and several of
his friends among the students piled on.</p>

<p>“May we have a ride?” asked three pretty
girls from the town. None of our friends knew
them, but it was a common custom to give all a
ride for whom there was room, introductions being
dispensed with.</p>

<p>“Pile on!” invited Tom.</p>

<p>“I want the one with the red scarf!” sang
out Frank, and this girl, with a laugh that showed
her even white teeth, took her place behind the
steersman. Her companions joined her, with
happy laughs. The bob was almost full.</p>

<p>“Room for any more?” asked a voice, and
Tom looked up to see a young man and lady looking
at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Mr. Beach!” he exclaimed, as he
recognized a friend of his who lived in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
“Of course there is. Get on Mrs. Beach, and
we’ll give you a fine ride!” The young married
couple had often entertained our four friends at
their home, and, as Mr. and Mrs. Beach were
fond of fun, they had come out to enjoy the coasting.</p>

<p>“All right!” cried Sid, clanging the bell.</p>

<p>“Push us off; will you?” Tom requested of a
merry coaster, and the lad with some others obligingly
shoved the bob to the edge of the hill. Then
they were off, going down like the wind, while the
runners scraped the frozen snow sending it aloft
in a shower of crystals that the moon turned into
silver.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is glorious!” cried the girl back of
Frank. “Say, did you ever try to go through the
hollow, and up the other hill?”</p>

<p>“No, and I’m not going to,” replied Frank,
turning his head toward her for an instant, and
then getting his eyes on the road again, for there
were many sleds and bobs, and it needed all his
skill to wind in and out among them.</p>

<p>“Why not?” persisted the girl, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Too dangerous, with a big sled. We never
could make the curve at this speed.”</p>

<p>“Some of the town boys do it,” she went on.</p>

<p>“Not with a bob like this. Look out there!”
Frank yelled as he narrowly missed running into
a solitary coaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The path to which the girl referred was a
sort of lane, running off the main hill road, dipping
down, and then suddenly shooting up again,
crossing over a slight rise, and finally going down
to a small pond. It was a semi-public road, but
seldom used. To attempt to negotiate it with a
swift bob was perilous, for the least mistake in
steering, or a slight accident would send the sled
off to one side or the other of the small hill, making
an upset almost certain, and, likely broken
bones, if nothing worse.</p>

<p>“There goes one boy, now,” went on the girl
back of Frank, as a coaster shot into the hollow.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he only has a small sled. I’ll not
try it. If you girls want to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed!” she hastened to assure him.
“This is too much fun. It’s good of you to ask
us.”</p>

<p>The coast soon came to an end, and then came
the hard work of dragging the sled up the hill
again.</p>

<p>“I wish they had double acting hills,” remarked
Tom as he pulled on the rope. “Slide down ’em
one way, and, when you get to the bottom they’d
tip up, and you could slide back&mdash;sort of perpetual
motion.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want much,” commented Sid with
a laugh.</p>

<p>As the boys reached the top of the slope there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dashed up a sled filled with young people, drawn
by two prancing horses. And fastened to the
rear of the sled, was a large bob.</p>

<p>“Now for some fun!” cried a girl’s voice.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Tom, of Phil.
“It sounded like your sister Ruth.”</p>

<p>“It is Ruth!” cried Phil, as he caught sight of
the girl who had called out. “It’s a crowd from
Fairview,” he added, naming a co-educational institution
not far from Randall, at which college
Ruth Clinton attended. “Hi, Ruth!” called her
brother, “how are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phil,” she answered. “So glad to see
you! Are the other inseparables there?”</p>

<p>“All of us!” cried Tom, as he glimpsed Madge
Tyler. “Come have a ride on our bob.”</p>

<p>“Next time,” answered Mabel Harrison with a
laugh. “We have a prior invitation now.”</p>

<p>“Who are with you?” asked Phil of his sister
as he reached her side. “Whose bob is that?”
and he pointed to the one back of the sled.</p>

<p>“Hal Burton’s. He’s a new student, rather
rich, and sporty I guess. He made up this little
party. Oh, it’s all right,” she hastened to add, as
she saw her brother look at her curiously. “We
have permission, a chaperone and all the fixings.
Trust the ogress, Miss Philock, for that. Isn’t it
a glorious night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine,” agreed Phil. “But who is this Burton
chap?”</p>

<p>“Come on, and I’ll introduce you,” and Ruth
presented her brother. Among the other girls
was a Miss Helen Newton, whom Tom and his
chums had not before met. She was also made
acquainted with the inseparables.</p>

<p>“And so you won’t ride with us?” asked Tom,
looking rather regretfully at Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>“Not this time, old man,” broke in Burton,
with a familiar air that Tom did not like. “I’m
going to pilot ’em.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the hill?” asked Phil quietly.
Somehow he did not like this new student, with
his calm air of assurance, and he did not like Ruth
to ride with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve coasted bigger hills than this,” declared
the owner of the big bob. “This isn’t anything,
even if it is a new one. Get on girls and
fellows!” he cried. “We’ll beat everything on
the hill.”</p>

<p>“Insolent puppy!” murmured Tom, as he
helped swing their own bob around for another
coast.</p>

<p>The sled owned by Burton was a fine one, and
larger even than that of our friends. There were
back-rests for each coaster, and a gong as big as
a dinner plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“See you later, Phil,” called Ruth, as she and
her girl friends, together with a throng of others,
got aboard.</p>

<p>The big bob was pushed off, Tom and his chums
watching with critical eyes. Burton seemed to
know his business.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well go down,” remarked
Frank, as he took his place. There was a moment’s
wait, while their bob filled, the same three
pretty girls taking their places. Then they were
off, Sid ringing the bell vigorously.</p>

<p>Hardly had they started, however, almost in
the wake of Burton’s sled, than Frank gave a cry
of alarm.</p>

<p>“What is it?” shouted Tom, getting ready to
jam on the brake. “Steering wheel busted?”</p>

<p>“No, but look!” cried Frank. “That chump
Burton is headed right for the hollow cut-off!
He’ll never make it at that speed, and there’ll be
a spill!”</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence, broken only
by the scraping of the runners on the hard snow.
Then Frank yelled:</p>

<p>“Keep to the right! Keep to the right, Burton!
You can’t make that turn!”</p>

<p>But Burton either did not hear or did not heed.
Straight for the perilous cut-off he steered, and
then, as the girls saw their danger, they cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shrilly. But it was too late to turn aside now, and
Tom and his chums, coming on like the wind behind
the new bob, wondered what would happen,
and if there was any way of preventing the accident
that seemed almost sure to take place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>BAD NEWS FROM HOME</small></h2>


<p>Years ago, it was the custom, for a certain
style of stories, to begin something like this:</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang! Seven redskins bit the dust!”</p>

<p>Then, after the sensational opening, came a
calm period wherein the author was privileged to
do some explaining. I shall, with your permission,
adopt that method now, with certain modifications,
and tell my new readers something about Randall
College, and the lads whom I propose to make my
heroes. It is, perhaps, rather an inopportune
time to do it, but I fear I will find none better,
since Tom and his chums are so constantly on the
alert, that it is hard to gain their attention for a
moment, after they are once started.</p>

<p>And so, while the bob containing the girls, in
whom our friends are so much interested, is swinging
toward the dangerous hollow, and when Tom
and the others are preparing to execute a risky
manœuvre to save them, may I be granted just a
moment? My former readers may skip this part
if they choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the initial volume of this “College
Sports Series,” that I introduced Tom Parsons
and his chums. The first book was called “The
Rival Pitchers;” and in it I told how Tom, a raw
country lad, came to Randall College with a big
ambition as regards baseball, and how he made
good in the box against long odds. In the second
book, “A Quarter-back’s Pluck,” I told how Phil
Clinton won the big championship game under trying
conditions, and in “Batting to Win,” there
were given the particulars of how Randall triumphed
over her rivals, and how a curious mystery
regarding Sid Henderson was solved.</p>

<p>“The Winning Touchdown,” was another story
of college football, and, incidentally the book
tells how Tom and his chums saved the college
from disaster in a peculiar way, and how Frank
came to Randall and “made good.” Frank had
roomed elsewhere but was now with Tom, Sid and
Phil.</p>

<p>Randall College was situated on the outskirts
of the town of Haddonfield, in the middle west.
Near it ran Sunny River, a stream of considerable
importance, emptying into Tonoka Lake. This
lake gave the name to the athletic league&mdash;the
league made up of Randall, Boxer Hall, Fairview
Institute and some other places of learning in the
vicinity. Randall often met Boxer Hall and Fairview
on the gridiron or diamond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Albertus Churchill, dubbed “Moses,” was
head-master at Randall, Dr. Emerson Tines,
called “Pitchfork,” was the Latin instructor, and
Mr. Andrew Zane was the proctor.</p>

<p>There were other instructors, officials, etc.,
whom you will meet as the story goes on. As for
the students, besides the four “inseparables”
whom I have already named, I have already told
you of some, though I might mention Sam or
“Snail” Looper, much given to night prowling,
Peter or “Grasshopper” Backus, who aspired to
be a great jumper, and “Bean” Perkins, who
could always be depended on to “root” for his
team in a contest.</p>

<p>These lads were all friends of our heroes.
Truth to tell, the lads had few enemies. Fred
Langridge and his crony Garvey Gerhart, had
made trouble for Tom and his friends, until the
two bullies withdrew from Randall, and went to
Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>And now, having read (or skipped) this necessary
explanation, you may proceed with the story.</p>

<p>“He must be crazy!” called Tom to Sid, who,
clanging the bell, was seated not far from the
brake-tender. “Clean crazy to try to coast the
hollow on his first trip.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know any better,” returned Sid,
as he looked ahead at the big bob which was nearing
the dangerous turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s Frank up to?” demanded Phil.
“He’s steering for the hollow, too.”</p>

<p>At this there was a scream of terror from some
of the girls on the bob of our heroes.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it! Don’t try it!” begged the one
next to Frank.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, please,” he requested in a tense
voice. “I’ve got to save them if possible.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to jump off!” a girl cried.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare!” ordered the Big Californian,
and there was that in his voice which made
her obey.</p>

<p>From the big bob in front, which was now only
a little way ahead of the Randall sled, came a
chorus of shrill screams. There was a movement,
plainly seen in the bright moonlight, as if some
of the girls were going to roll off.</p>

<p>“Sit still! Sit still!” yelled Frank. “Jam on
your brakes there, Burton!” he added. “You’ll
never make that turn!”</p>

<p>“All right, I get you!” sang out the newcomer
on the hill, and Phil gritted his teeth as he thought
of his sister&mdash;and the other girls&mdash;entrusted to a
reckless youth like this.</p>

<p>There was a scraping sound, as one of the lads
on Burton’s bob pulled the cord that sent a chisel-like
piece of steel down into the snow-covered
roadway. But the speed of the sled was not much
checked by this brake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the two big bobs were close together,
and the dangerous turn was almost at
hand. All the other coasters on the hill, save a
few that were near the bottom, had stopped their
sport to see the outcome of the perilous ride.</p>

<p>“Look out, Frank, you’ll be into them!” yelled
Tom, as he saw their bob coming nearer and nearer
to the foremost one. “Shall I jam on the
brakes?”</p>

<p>His hand was on the cord, and, in another moment
he would have sent the scraping steel back of
the rear runner, into the frozen surface.</p>

<p>“No! No!” yelled Frank. “Don’t touch that
brake, Tom! I want all the speed I can get!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” cried his chum.</p>

<p>“I’m going to head them away from the cut-off.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do it!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to!” retorted Frank grimly. “Easy
on the brake, Tom.”</p>

<p>“All right! She’s off!”</p>

<p>The girls on both bobs were now quiet, but they
were none the less in great fear. The very danger
seemed to make them dumb, and they looked
ahead with frightened eyes, waiting for they knew
not what.</p>

<p>A moment later Frank’s plan was plain to his
chums. Knowing the hill as he did, familiar with
every bump and hollow, he had decided, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to draw up alongside the foremost bob, between
it and the dangerous turn, which Burton
did not seem able to avoid. Then Frank would
hold a straight course, if he could, and fairly
force the other sled out of danger.</p>

<p>It was a risky plan, but none other would serve
to prevent the big, new bob from shooting
toward the smaller hill, with the certainty of overturning.</p>

<p>“Steer to the right&mdash;more to the right!” yelled
Frank to Burton. “I’m coming up on your left!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t!” was the answer. “My steering
wheel is jammed!”</p>

<p>“You can never make it, Frank,” called Phil.
“There isn’t room between that bob and the turn
to get in. You’ll upset us!”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t! Just sit still! I’m going to do
it!”</p>

<p>There was a quiet determination in the voice of
the Big Californian, a comparatively newcomer at
Randall.</p>

<p>With a rushing whizz Frank steered his bob
up alongside of the other. It was just this side of
the dangerous turn, toward which Burton was
headed. He was unable to do anything toward
guiding his sled, and the brake, though jammed
on full, only served partly to slacken the speed.
But this slackening was enough to permit the faster
bob from Randall to creep up, and just in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Steering with the utmost skill, Frank sent his
bob as close as he dared to the other. It was on
his right, while on his left, dipping down with
dizzying suddenness, was the turning slope that
might lead to danger, or even death.</p>

<p>Frank thrust out his foot, and planted it firmly
on the foremost sled of the new bob. At the same
time he twisted his steering wheel to the right, so
as to gain all the leverage he could toward forcing
Burton’s bob away from the turn.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">For a moment matters hung in the balance.</a> An
inch or two to the left would send both bobs
crashing down the dangerous slope. There was a
shower of ice splinters in the moonlight, a chorus
of frightened gasps from the girls, and sharp
breathing by the boys. Then the weight, and
true steering qualities, of the Randall bob told.
Slowly but surely she forced the other away, and,
a moment later, as the defective steering gear on
Burton’s sled gave way, there was a mix-up, and
both craft overturned, while there came shrieks of
dismay from all the girls.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

     title="FOR A MOMENT MATTERS HUNG IN THE BALANCE." /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_21">FOR A MOMENT MATTERS HUNG IN THE BALANCE.</a></span>
</div>

<p>But the upset had occurred in a soft bank of
snow, and, aside from the discomfort, no one was
hurt.</p>

<p>“If it had happened ten feet back though&mdash;well,
there’d been a different story to tell,” mused
Tom, as he and his companions helped the girls out
of the conglomeration of sleds and drifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did you want to try anything like that
for?” asked Phil of Burton, when there was some
semblance of calmness.</p>

<p>“Well, a fellow dared me to coast into the
hollow, and I said I would.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do it again&mdash;with <em>my</em> sister
aboard,” growled Phil.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” cried Madge Tyler. “If we’d
known he was going to do that we wouldn’t have
ridden with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no harm’s done,” spoke Burton with a
laugh. “I can soon fix that steering gear, and
we’ll have some fun yet.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” replied Miss Harrison. “I
think we have had enough for one night.”</p>

<p>“Come on our bob,” invited Tom eagerly. “It’s
early yet.”</p>

<p>“Shall we?” asked Ruth, a sparkle of mischief
in her eyes. “We’re not really hurt, you know,
and&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let’s do it,” begged Miss Newton,
and so, leaving Burton to his damaged bob, the
girls went with Tom and his chums. They had
several glorious coasts, under the silver moon,
which shone with undiminished splendor.</p>

<p>Hal Burton got his bob in shape again, and
begged the girls to try a ride, but they would not,
and he was forced to content himself with others.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll be unpleasant toward you, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
back to Fairview in the horse sled,” suggested
Phil, to his sister.</p>

<p>“He didn’t hire that,” retorted Ruth. “We
girls clubbed together and got that, and invited
the boys. But I think we’d better be going; it’s
getting late.”</p>

<p>There was one more last, jolly coast, and then
the college girls and boys wended their way from
the hill, calling good-nights to each other.</p>

<p>“When are you coming over, Phil?” asked his
sister, as she and the others climbed in the big
horse-drawn sleigh.</p>

<p>“Do you mean our <em>crowd</em>?” asked her brother,
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;<em>everybody</em>!” added Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” answered Tom promptly.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” retorted Miss Harrison. “We have
an exam. the next day. Make it Friday, and we’ll
have a little dance.”</p>

<p>“Done!” shouted Sid.</p>

<p>“And he’s the old misogynist who used to hate
the ladies!” chaffed Tom, at his chum’s ready
acceptance. There was a laugh, and then the
four inseparables, in the midst of groups of their
friends, trudged on toward Randall.</p>

<p>“There was some class to your steering, Frank,
old man,” complimented Tom, after some talk of
the near-accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Phil. “I never thought
he’d make it.”</p>

<p>“I just <em>had</em> to,” was the response. “There’d
have been a bad time, if that chump had gone
down into the hollow.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” put in Sid. “I wonder how he
came to get in with our girls, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“<em>Our</em> girls!” cried Tom. “How many do you
own, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what I mean,” said Sid. Then
the students fell to discussing the matter, speculating
as to what sort of a chap Hal Burton might
turn out to be.</p>

<p>“Well, we had a good time,” remarked Tom,
a little later, as the four entered the room they
shared in common. “Hello!” he cried, “the
clock has stopped.”</p>

<p>He caught up a nickel-plated alarm timepiece,
and began shaking it vigorously.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” gasped Phil
indignantly, as he snatched the clock from Tom.
“Do you want to ruin it?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to make it go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and get the hair-spring caught up so
she’ll do two hours in the time of one. Handle
it gently, you vandal!” and he rocked the clock
easily to and fro, until a loud ticking indicated
that it had started again.</p>

<p>“And now for boning,” remarked Frank, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sank into one of the twin armchairs that adorned
the room. One was a relic&mdash;an heirloom&mdash;and
the other had come to the boys in a peculiar manner.
Both were old and worn, but the personification
of comfort&mdash;so much so that once you had
gotten into one you did not want to get out. Also
it was hard work to arise unassisted, because of
the depth.</p>

<p>Tom took the other chair, and Sid and Phil
shared the dilapidated sofa between them. It
creaked and groaned with their weight.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to be investing in a new one,
soon,” remarked Phil, as he tenderly felt of the
sofa’s ‘bones’. “This won’t last much longer.”</p>

<p>“It will serve our time,” spoke Sid. “Don’t
you dare suggest a new one. It would be sacrilege.”</p>

<p>Tired, but happy and contented, and in a glorious
glow from their coasting, the boys began looking
for their books, to do a last bit of studying
before the signal for “lights out” should sound.</p>

<p>“Where’s my Greek dictionary?” demanded
Phil, searching among a litter of papers on the
table. “I’m sure I left it here.”</p>

<p>“The last I saw of it, you fired it at Dutch
Housenlager the other day when he stuck his head
in the door,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, here it is,” announced Phil, unearthing
the volume from under a big catching glove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“Hello, Tom, here’s a letter for you! Special
delivery, too! Must have come when you were
out, and Wallops, the messenger, left it in here.
Catch!”</p>

<p>He tossed the missive to Tom, who caught it,
and ripped it open quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s from home,” he murmured, as he read it.
Then a change came over his face&mdash;a change that
was instantly apparent to his chums.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sid softly. “No
bad news I hope, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;it is&mdash;very bad news,” replied Tom
softly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>WHEN SPRING COMES</small></h2>


<p>There was silence in the room&mdash;a silence
broken only by the ticking of the fussy alarm
clock, which seemed to be doing its best to distract
attention from the unwelcome letter. It was
as if it were chanting over and over again:</p>

<p>“Come-on! Come-on! All-right! All-right!”</p>

<p>Finally the constant ticking got on the nerves of
Sid, and he stopped it by the simple, but effective
means of jamming a toothpick in the back of the
clock, where there is a slot for regulating the hair
spring.</p>

<p>Tom read his letter over again.</p>

<p>“Is there&mdash;that is, can we&mdash;Oh, hang it, you
know what I mean, Tom!” blurted out Phil. “Is
there anything we can do to help you? If there
is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” replied Tom softly. “It’s
some trouble dad is in, and&mdash;well, of course it may
affect me.”</p>

<p>“Affect you&mdash;how?” asked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s this way,” went on the Randall pitcher.
“Dad, you know, is a farmer. That’s how he
made what little money he has, and, in the last
few years he laid by quite a bit. About a year
ago, he was persuaded to invest it in a Western
horse deal. He sunk about all he had, and&mdash;well,
those Westerners double-crossed him. They got
his money, and froze him out.”</p>

<p>“That’s like some fellows in the West, but not
all,” broke in Frank Simpson, bound to stick up
for his own region. “How did it happen, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I never heard all the particulars, only I know
that dad invested his money, and he never got any
return from it. Those Western horse dealers
kept it, and the horses too.”</p>

<p>“But that was a year ago,” spoke Sid. “What’s
new about it?”</p>

<p>“This,” replied Tom. “Dad brought suit at
law against them to recover his money, and the
case was just decided&mdash;against him.”</p>

<p>“Jove! That’s too bad!” exclaimed Sid.
“But can’t he&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dad’s appealed the case,” went on Tom,
“but it’s this way, fellows. If he loses on the
appeal I’ve got to quit Randall.”</p>

<p>“Quit Randall!” cried the three in chorus.</p>

<p>“Yes, quit Randall. There won’t be money
enough to keep me here. I’ll have to go to work
a year or so earlier than I expected to, and help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
support the family. That’s what dad writes to me
about. He says I must not be disappointed if I
have to come away at any time, and buckle down
to hard work. He says he’s sorry, of course&mdash;but,
hang it all, I don’t blame him a bit!” cried
Tom, blowing his nose unnecessarily hard. “I
really ought to go to work I suppose. And, if
this suit on appeal goes against us, I will. It’s up
to the judge of the higher court now, whether dad
gets his money or not.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t leave Randall,” declared Phil.
“We’re depending on you for the baseball nine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and for track athletics,” added Sid.
“There’s talk of forming a new league for track
athletics, and that will mean a lot to Randall. You
simply can’t go, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope I don’t have to,” and the pitcher
folded his letter thoughtfully, and put it in his
pocket. “But if it has to be&mdash;it has to, that’s all.
Let’s talk of something pleasant. What’s this
about track athletics?”</p>

<p>No one knew very much about it, save that
there had been a proposition that, in addition to
having a football and baseball team, as well as
possibly a rowing crew, Randall try for some of
the honors in all-around athletics&mdash;broad and high
jumping, putting the shot, hurdles, and hundred
yard and other dashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it would be a good thing,” declared
Tom. “With Spring coming soon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Spring!” broke in Phil. “It looks a lot like
Spring; doesn’t it? with us just back from a coasting
party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, this snow fall was out of date,” declared
Sid.</p>

<p>“Spring will be here before we know it,” went
on Frank, in dreamy tones. “I can almost hear
the frogs croaking in the pond now. Oh, for
glorious, warm and sunny Spring. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” cried Phil, shying a book at his
chum. “You’re as bad as Tom with your poetry,”
and they all looked toward the pitcher, who
seemed unusually downcast.</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll have to go soon?” asked
Sid, after a pause.</p>

<p>“I hope not at all,” answered Tom, “but there
is no telling. If the case goes against dad I’ll
leave, of course, and buckle down to hard work.
If he wins it&mdash;why, I’ll stay on here.”</p>

<p>“And take part in the athletic contests?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, if they need me, and I have a show.
But I’m not so much good at that. Did you ever
have a try at ’em, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I used to do some jumping, and occasionally
a pole vault.”</p>

<p>“Listen to Mr. Modesty!” blurted out Sid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
“Why, fellows, he holds the Western amateur
record for the broad jump! Twenty feet one
inch&mdash;and Sheran only did six and a half inches
better,” and Sid rapidly turned to the pages of an
athletic almanac, where records were given. “He
ran, too. Beat in the mile contest.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” cried Tom. “And you never told
us.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was sort of luck,” spoke Frank modestly.
“I did my best, but that day there weren’t
very many contestants. I beat ’em all, but, as I
said it was luck.”</p>

<p>“Luck nothing!” grumbled Phil. “Why don’t
you own up to it that broad jumping is your
specialty.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is, in a way. I like to run better,
though. I’d be glad if we did have some track
athletics at Randall.”</p>

<p>“How about Pete Backus?” asked Tom with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;Grasshopper,” cried Phil. “I suppose
he’ll go in for the jump, too.”</p>

<p>“The more the merrier,” commented Frank.
“But does any one know anything definite about
this?”</p>

<p>No one did, beyond rumors that the athletic
committee was considering it. Then they fell to
talking of what might happen when the Spring
came, of records, past performances, of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
baseball and football games won and lost, and, by
degrees, Tom felt less keenly the unpleasant news
that had come to him.</p>

<p>“I do hope your dad wins that case!” exclaimed
Phil, as they were getting ready for bed,
on hearing the warning bell ring. “We don’t
want to lose you, Tom.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to go, but still, a fellow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know, he has to do his duty. I sometimes
feel that I ought to be at work helping the family
instead of staying here, where it costs considerable,”
interrupted Phil. “But if I ever can I’m
going to make it up to them. Wait until I get my
degree, and the law cases come pouring in on me,
with big fees&mdash;say, maybe I could give your dad
some points!” he exclaimed, for Phil was considering
the law as his profession.</p>

<p>“Well, dad has hired about all the lawyers he
can afford,” replied Tom with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean for a retainer!” cried Phil.
“I’d take the case for practice.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell dad,” was the pitcher’s smiling answer.</p>

<p>From the easy chairs, and the rickety sofa, the
lads arose, amid clouds of dust. The alarm clock,
that served to awaken them in time for first chapel
call, was set going again, and carefully placed under
some cushions that the ticking might not keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
them awake, while yet the bell might summon
them in time for worship next morning.</p>

<p>“We surely must do something to that sofa,”
remarked Phil, as he pressed down on the old
springs. “We need a new one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to have this one revamped.
It feels like lying on a pile of bricks to stretch out
on it now. I think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hark!” interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>There were loud voices out in the hall. Voices
in dispute.</p>

<p>“I tell you I will go out!” exclaimed someone.</p>

<p>“But the last bell is just going to ring,” expostulated
another, whom the boys recognized as
a hall monitor.</p>

<p>“What do I care! I can fool Zane. Stand
aside!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then the
strokes of the retiring bell peeled out through the
dormitories.</p>

<p>“There! I told you!” said the monitor.
“You can’t go. If you do, I’ll have to report you.”</p>

<p>“All right, report and be hanged to you!” and
then followed the sound of a scuffle in the corridor,
as if some one was shoving the monitor aside.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE NEW FELLOW</small></h2>


<p>“Something’s up,” remarked Tom in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Phil. “But who is it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a look,” volunteered Sid, and, with
a quick motion he turned out the electric light,
somewhat of an innovation in Randall. Then he
tiptoed to the door, which he opened on a crack.
Through the aperture came the noise of retreating
footsteps, and it was evident to the strained
ears of the four chums that someone was going
down the hall, toward the broad stairway that led
out on the campus, while someone else was proceeding
toward the main part of the dormitory,
where Proctor Zane had a sort of auxiliary office.</p>

<p>“Who is it&mdash;can you see?” demanded Tom
Parsons, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“No! Keep still, can’t you? Wait until he
gets under the hall light,” was the reply from Sid.</p>

<p>“One of ’em was Franklin, the monitor for this
floor; I’m sure of that,” declared Phil. “I know
his voice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the other&mdash;&mdash;” began Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s that new fellow,” interrupted Sid as he,
just then, caught a glimpse of the youth who had
caused the disturbance. “He came in yesterday,
don’t you remember. He’s in the soph. science
division. Gabbler&mdash;Rabbler or some such name
as that.”</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed Tom. “It’s Shambler&mdash;Jake
Shambler. He introduced himself to me
after first lecture. Rather fresh, I thought him,
even if he did make the soph. class. What’s he
doing?”</p>

<p>“Going out, as near as I can tell,” replied Sid.
“He must have had a scuffle with Franklin. Well,
it’s none of our funeral. Let’s turn in. I’m dead
tired.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a chap is he?” asked Frank, in
rather idle curiosity, as with the light once more
switched on, the four boys proceeded to get ready
for bed.</p>

<p>“Not our sort at all,” replied Tom. “Decent
enough appearing, and all that, but the kind that
thinks he knows it all. That was a fair sample,
the way he talked to the monitor just now.”</p>

<p>“Serve him right if he got caught,” murmured
Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get it all right,” declared Sid. “Pop
Zane isn’t as easy as he was when we first came
here. He’s right up to the mark, and if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Shambler thinks he can shuffle off the campus, and
come back when it pleases his own sweet will, he’ll
have another guess coming. What did he say to
you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much.”</p>

<p>“It must have been something.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was in a hurry, and I didn’t pay much
attention. He wanted to know something about
athletics, whether we’d have a ball team or not.
I said we probably would, and then he wanted to
know what show there was for track athletics. I
didn’t know, so I couldn’t tell him. Then I
thought he was getting too friendly on short
notice, so I shook him.”</p>

<p>“Nice way for one of Randall’s old stand-bys
to treat a stranger, in a strange land,” commented
Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t be a stranger long,” declared
Tom. “He has brass enough to carry him anywhere.
He’ll get along. I don’t believe we want
him in our crowd, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the others and then, as
the last bell, for “lights out” resounded through
the dormitory, they leaped into bed.</p>

<p>If Jake Shambler, or any others who tried to
“run the guard” that night were caught, it did not
come to the notice of our friends. They awoke
betimes the next morning, and, as usual hastened
to chapel, making the last of their simple toilets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on the way, for, somehow, neck scarfs never did
seem to lend themselves to quick tying, in the early
hours of dawn.</p>

<p>“Well, I hear you lads had a grand time last
night,” remarked Holly Cross to the “inseparables,”
as they paused on the chapel steps.
“Saved fair maidens in distress, and all that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we were on the job with the bob,” laughed
Tom. “Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Doing the virtuous&mdash;boning Latin.”</p>

<p>“Like Cæsar!” exploded Sid.</p>

<p>“No, Cicero,” said Holly gravely. “Vandal,
to doubt the word of your betters!”</p>

<p>“Oh cheese it, Holly. You&mdash;&mdash;” began Phil,
but the warning bell ushered them into the sacred
precincts of the chapel, over the exercises of which
Dr. Churchill presided with his usual solemnity.</p>

<p>“There’s Shambler,” spoke Tom in a low voice
to Sid, as the four filed out, soon to separate in
order to attend different classes.</p>

<p>“Who, that big chap with the red cap?”</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow!”</p>

<p>“Looks as though he had plenty of bone and
muscle,” commented Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s coming over here,” went on Tom.
“We’ll have to be decent to him, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>Shambler approached. There was a certain
breezy air about him, a good-natured manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a seeming feeling of confidence, that, while it
might be all right, once you had made friends
with him, yet was rather antagonizing at first
appearance. It was as if the new student took too
much for granted, and this is never overlooked
among college lads.</p>

<p>Shambler nodded to Tom, in what he meant to
be a friendly fashion, and began to keep step with
him. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“I say, I didn’t know it was the fashion at
Randall for everybody to go to bed with the
chickens.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” said Tom shortly.</p>

<p>“It seems so,” was the rejoinder. “I was out
for a lark last night, and I couldn’t find anyone
from around here to have fun with. I went past
your room and it was as dark as a pocket&mdash;you’re
on my corridor; aren’t you&mdash;sixty-eight?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly were sporting your oak.
Did you hear the run-in I had with a monitor?
Beastly fresh. I made out all right, fooled the
proc. good and proper. I wish you had been along.
Are these your friends?”</p>

<p>Shambler included Sid, Phil and Frank, in a
comprehensive wave of his hand, and there was
no choice but for Tom to introduce them, which
he did with the best grace possible.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you!” exclaimed Shambler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
holding out a muscular hand. “I hear you’re in
the athletic set. That’s where I want to get, too,
though I’m fond of a good time, and not too much
training. I had bully fun last night. Met some
fellows from Boxer Hall, and we stayed in town
quite late. Don’t you ever hit it up?”</p>

<p>“Not very often,” replied Sid, a bit coldly.
“Well,” he added, “I’m going to leave you fellows.
I’ve got a lecture on.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” added Tom, and, not to his very
great pleasure, Shambler linked his arm in that of
the pitcher’s, and walked off with him, remarking:</p>

<p>“I’m due for the same thing, old man. Do you
mind if I sit with you? I’d be glad if you’d give
me a few pointers. They do things a bit differently
at the lectures here than at Harkness, where
I came from. The old man’s business changed,
and I had to come here. How about cutting lectures?”</p>

<p>“It can be done,” spoke Tom coldly, for it was
not his habit to indulge in this practice. There
were a few other commonplace remarks, and then
the college day fairly began.</p>

<p>Not until that afternoon did Tom meet his
three chums again, and then, in coming from the
last lecture of the day, he heard footsteps behind
him, and turned to see Shambler hurrying to catch
up to him.</p>

<p>“I say!” began the new student. “I meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to tell you. I met some fine chaps last night from
Boxer Hall. They’re coming over this afternoon
to call for me. I was wondering whether you
and your chums wouldn’t like to come out with us.
We’re going to hire a drag and take a ride.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” began Tom. He appreciated
the spirit in which Shambler gave the invitation,
and yet he did not altogether like the fellow. Besides,
he did not want to break up the pleasant
relations so long existing among the inseparables,
and he knew that spirit would vanish if a fifth
member was introduced.</p>

<p>Still he did not quite see how he could “shake”
Shambler. Ahead of him Tom saw Sid, Phil and
Frank waiting for him, and on their faces he detected
a look of annoyance, as they beheld his
companion. But the problem was solved for him.</p>

<p>“By Jove! There are the Boxer Hall boys
now!” cried Shambler, waving his hands to some
youths who were discernable on the far side of the
big campus. “Come on over, and we’ll have some
fun.”</p>

<p>Tom took one look at the two newcomers. In
an instant he recognized them as the enemies of
himself and his chums&mdash;Fred Langridge and his
crony, Garvey Gerhart.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m afraid you’ll have to excuse me,” murmured
Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why&mdash;what’s wrong?” asked Shambler,
curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact of the matter is that your new
friends would hardly thank you for bringing us
together,” answered Tom simply, as he swung off
and joined his chums, leaving a rather mystified
student standing staring after him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>IN “PITCHFORK’S” PLACE</small></h2>


<p>“Well I say now! I wonder what’s up? Could
I have&mdash;&mdash;” Thus began Shambler to commune
with himself as he watched Tom. “Something’s
wrong. He doesn’t like Langridge and Gerhart,
that’s evident. I must find out about this.”</p>

<p>Which he very soon did, after a short talk with
his new chums, and my readers may be sure that
Tom and his friends did not get any of the best of
the showing, in the account Langridge and his
crony gave of their affair, and the reasons for
their withdrawal to Boxer Hall, told of in a previous
volume of this series.</p>

<p>“Humph! If that’s the kind of lads they are
I don’t want anything to do with them,” said
Shambler, as he gazed after the retreating inseparables,
following the tale of Langridge and
Gerhart.</p>

<p>“They’re not our style at all,” declared Langridge
with a sneer. “Still, don’t let us keep you
from them, if you’d rather train in their camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m out for a good time!” declared
Shambler boastfully. “I only tried to get in with
them as I heard they were in the athletic crowd,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hot athletes they are!” sneered Gerhart.
“Say, if this talked-of an all-around athletic contest
comes off this Spring, and our college goes in
for it, we’ll wipe up the field with Randall, and
Fairview too. They won’t know they started. I
don’t see why you didn’t come to Boxer Hall,
Shambler.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had, but it’s too late now. But say,
I’m going in for athletics, even if you fellows think
you can do us up. I don’t have to train with the
Parsons crowd to do it though.”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Langridge. “And so you
offered to introduce Tom Parsons to us. Ha!
Ha! No wonder he shied off!” and he laughed
sneeringly. “But, if we’re going to town, come
on before it gets too late.” And with that the
trio swung off toward the trolley line that would
take them to Haddonfield.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom and his chums tramped over
the snow-covered campus, idly kicking the white
flakes aside.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much like baseball; does it?”
remarked Tom, as he made a snowball, and tossed
it high in the air.</p>

<p>“No, but it can’t last forever,” declared Sid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“I say, did any of you hear anything more about
having a track team, and going in for field athletics
this Spring?”</p>

<p>“Only general talk,” replied Phil.</p>

<p>“There goes Dutch Housenlager,” spoke
Frank. “Let’s see if he knows anything.”</p>

<p>“He’s got his back turned,” whispered Tom.
“It’s a good chance to play a joke on him. Get
in front of him, Sid, and be talking to him. I’ll
sneak up, and kneel down in back. Then give
him a gentle push and he’ll upset and turn a somersault
over me.”</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated Phil. “It will be one
that we’ve owed Dutch for a long time.”</p>

<p>The trick was soon in process of being played.
While Sid held the big lad in earnest conversation,
about the possibility of a track team for Randall,
Tom silently knelt down behind him. Then Sid,
seeing that all was in readiness, spoke:</p>

<p>“Have you seen the new style of putting the
shot, Dutch?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” replied the unsuspecting
one. “How is it done?”</p>

<p>“This way,” answered Sid as, with a quick pressure
against the chest of Dutch, he sent him
sprawling over Tom’s bent back, legs and arms
outstretched.</p>

<p>“Here! I say! Wow! What&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the rest that Dutch gave expression to was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
unintelligible, for he and Tom were rolling over
and over in the snow, tightly clenched.</p>

<p>“Event number one. Putting the shot!” cried
Sid, after the manner of an announcer giving a
score at track games, “Dutch Housenlager
thirty-seven feet, six and one-quarter inches!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” commanded Dutch, as he skillfully
tripped Tom, who had arisen to his feet.
“That’s one on me all right. Now, if you fellows
are done laughing, I’ve got a bit of news
for you.”</p>

<p>“About athletics?” asked Frank eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, but we’re going to have a new teacher in
Pitchfork’s place to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Tom, half disbelieving, as he got
up and brushed the snow from his garments.</p>

<p>“But yes!” insisted Dutch. “Our beloved and
respected Professor Emerson Tines&mdash;alias Pitchfork&mdash;has
been called to deliver a lecture on the
habits of the early Romans contrasted with those
of the cave dwellers. It’s to take place before
some high-brow society to-night, and he can’t get
back here to-morrow in time to take his classes.
He’s going to provide a substitute.”</p>

<p>“Oh joy!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Wait,” cautioned Frank. “The remedy may
be worse than the disease.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the sub?” asked Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Professor H. A. Broadkins, according to the
bulletin board,” replied Dutch.</p>

<p>“What’s ‘H. A.’ stand for?” Sid wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! of course,” replied Tom promptly.</p>

<p>“Joke!” spoke Frank solemnly.</p>

<p>“Harold Archibald,” declared Sid. “Oh, say,
we won’t do a thing to him. I’ll wager he’s one
of these pink and white little men, who wears a
number twelve collar, and parts his hair in the middle,
so he can walk a crack. Say, will to-morrow
ever come?”</p>

<p>“Don’t take too much for granted,” advised
Dutch. “I picked out a Harold Archibald once as
an easy mark, and I got left. This may not be
the same one, but&mdash;well, come on down the street.
I’ve got a quarter that’s burning a hole in my
pocket, and we might as well help Dobbins raise
the mortgage on his drug store, by getting some
hot chocolate there.”</p>

<p>“<em>Pro bono publico!</em>” ejaculated Tom. “Your
deeds will live after you, Dutch.”</p>

<p>“And if you upset me again, you’ll go to an
early grave,” declared the big lad, as the five
strolled off to recuperate after the arduous labors
of the day.</p>

<p>When Tom and his chums filed into Latin recitation
the next morning, there was a feeling of
expectancy on all sides, for the word had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
around that there might be “something doing”
in regard to the professor who had come to temporarily
fill the place of “Pitchfork.”</p>

<p>No one had seen him, as yet, but his probable
name of “Harold Archibald,” had been bandied
about until it was felt sure that it was an index
to his character and build. Judge then, of the surprise
of the lads, when they found awaiting them
a tall man of dark complexion, with a wealth of
dark hair, and a face like that of some football
player. He was muscular to a degree. There
was a gasp of distinct surprise, and several lads
who had come “not prepared” began to dip
surreptitiously into their Latin books, while others,
who had contemplated various and sundry tricks,
at once gave them over.</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen,” began Professor
H. A. Broadkins, in a deep, but not unpleasant
voice. (It developed later that his name was
Hannibal Achilles.) “I am sorry your regular
teacher is not here, but I will do the best I can.
You will recite in the usual way.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, much to the surprise of the boys,
he began giving them a little history of the
particular lesson for the day, roughly sketching
the events which led up to the happenings, and giving
reasons for them. It was much more interesting
than when “Pitchfork” had the class and the
boys did their best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dutch Housenlager had to have his joke.</p>

<p>The lesson had to do with some of the Roman
conquests, and, in order to illustrate how a certain
battle was fought the professor, by means of
books constructed a sort of model walled city.
The besiegers were represented by more books,
outside the walls.</p>

<p>“This was one of the first battles in which the
catapult was used,” went on the instructor. “You
can imagine the surprise of the besieged army
when the Romans wheeled this great engine of war
close to the walls, and began hurling great stones.
In a measure the catapult served to cover the attack
on another part of the city.</p>

<p>“For instance we will make a sort of catapult
by means of this ruler. This piece of mineral will
do for the stone, and er&mdash;I think I will ask one
of you young men to assist me&mdash;er&mdash;you,” and
he pointed to Dutch. “Just come here, and you
may work the catapult when I give the word. I
want to show the class how the other division of
the army sapped the walls.”</p>

<p>There came into the eyes of Dutch a gleam of
mischief, as he looked at the improvised catapult.
It consisted of a ruler balanced on a book, with a
piece of mineral, from a cabinet of geological
specimens, for the stone. By tapping the unweighted
end of the ruler smartly the rock could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
be made to fly over into the midst of the besieged
city. But Dutch also noticed something else.</p>

<p>There was, on the table where the professor
had laid out his map of battle, an inkwell. When
he thought the teacher was not looking Dutch
substituted the ink for the stone. A tap on the
ruler would now send the inkwell flying. Mr.
Broadkins did not seem to notice this as he went
on with his preparations to sap the city walls.</p>

<p>“Now we are all ready,” he announced. “You
may operate the catapult,” he added, apparently
not looking at it, and Dutch, with a grin at his
chums, prepared to hit the ruler a good blow. He
calculated that the ink would be well distributed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the professor changed his plans.
Without seemingly looking at Dutch, or the catapult,
he said:</p>

<p>“On second thoughts you may come here&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.
Housenlager. I will work the catapult, and
you may represent the invading division. All
ready now. Stand here.”</p>

<p>Dutch dared not disobey, nor dare he change
the inkwell for the innocent stone. Yet he knew,
and all the class could see, that he was standing
where he would get a dusky bath in another minute.
And the professor appeared all unconscious
of the inkwell.</p>

<p>“Ready!” called Mr. Broadkins, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
struck the unweighted end of the ruler a smart
blow.</p>

<p>Up into the air rose the bottle of ink. It described
a graceful curve, and then descended.
Dutch tried to dodge, but, somehow, he was not
quick enough, and the inkwell hit him on the
shoulder. Up splashed the black fluid, and a moment
later Dutch looked like a negro minstrel,
while a new pink tie, of which he was exceedingly
proud, took on a new and wonderful pattern in
burnt cork splatter design.</p>

<p>“Wow! Wuff!” spluttered the fun-loving
student, as some ink went in his mouth. And then
the class roared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE NEW LEAGUE</small></h2>


<p>Professor Broadkins looked up, as if mildly
surprised at the merriment of the students. He
glanced over into the walled city that he had
constructed out of books, and then at Dutch. The
sight of that worthy, with ink dripping from him
appeared to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“Why, er&mdash;Housenlager&mdash;what happened?”
inquired the instructor. “Did some one&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“It was the catapult,” explained Dutch. “I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;”
he choked out.</p>

<p>Then the professor seemed to understand.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;ink!” he said, innocently. “You used
the inkwell.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Dutch. “I&mdash;er&mdash;put the bottle
on the ruler, instead of the rock. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand,” interrupted the substitute
Latin instructor. “It is too bad. How did you
come to make that mistake, Housenlager?”</p>

<p>Once more the class laughed, and the lads were
not restrained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“You had better go to the lavatory, and wash,”
went on the instructor. “And I think you all
have, by this time, a better idea of a catapult than
you had before, even though the wrong sort of
missile was used. We will now proceed with the
lesson.”</p>

<p>It might fairly be presumed that not as much attention
was paid to the following instruction as was
needed, but, at the same time, there was an excuse.
Dutch came back to the class toward the
end of the recitation, with a clean collar and a
different necktie, and when the lecture was over
he did not join in the mirth of his fellow students.</p>

<p>“Dutch was in bad that time, all right,” remarked
Sid with a laugh, as the lads strolled out
on the campus.</p>

<p>“A regular fountain pen,” commented Tom.</p>

<p>“Want a blotter?” asked Phil, offering a bit
of paper.</p>

<p>“Or a pen wiper?” added Frank. “Say, how
did you come to make such a mistake, Dutch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up, will you?” begged the badgered
one. “It wasn’t any mistake. I thought he’d
get the ink instead of me.”</p>

<p>“And he changed places with you,” interposed
Tom. “Well, mistakes will happen, in the best
of regulated classes.”</p>

<p>“Oh say!” began Dutch. Then, despairing
of changing the subject, unless he took drastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
measures, he added: “How about coasting again
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Say, I believe it would be sport!” chimed in
Tom. “It’s getting warm, and the snow won’t
last much longer. Let’s get up a crowd, and go
out on the hill.”</p>

<p>The idea met with favor at once, and soon plans
were being made for a merry time.</p>

<p>“Telephone over to Fairview, and get your
sister and her crowd, Phil,” suggested Sid.</p>

<p>“Listen to the lady-killer!” jeered Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up,” importuned Sid. “I guess I’ve
got as much right as you fellows.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Stick up for your rights!”
cried Frank.</p>

<p>Though the moon was not as glorious as on the
previous evening, the night was a fine one, and a
merry party of young men and maidens gathered
on the hill with big bobs, the gongs of which
made clamorous music, amid the shouts and laughter.</p>

<p>There were several cliques of students, but Tom
and his crowd, with Phil’s sister and the girls who
were her chums, clung together and had many a
swift coast. It was when several were thinking of
starting for home that a party of lads, with a fine,
big bob appeared on the hill.</p>

<p>“Who wants a ride?” challenged the leader,
whom Tom recognized as Shambler. “Come on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
girls,” he went on, addressing Ruth Clinton, with
easy familiarity. “Get on, we’ll give you a good
coast.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care to,” said Ruth, turning aside.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s perfectly safe,” insisted Shambler.
“Come on! Be sports. Here, Gerhart&mdash;Langridge,
help the girls on!”</p>

<p>“They don’t need any help!” suddenly exclaimed
Tom, stepping between Shambler and
Ruth.</p>

<p>“How do you know&mdash;are you their manager?”
asked the new student with a sneer.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;but I’m her brother,” interposed Phil.
“Come on, Ruth, we’ll walk part way with you.”
He linked his arm in hers, Phil and his chums
began dragging their bob away, followed by
Madge Tyler, Mabel Harrison and Helen Newton.</p>

<p>“Humph!” sneered Shambler, audibly. “I
guess we got in wrong with that bunch, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” advised Langridge. “There are
other girls on the hill, and it’s early yet.”</p>

<p>And that night, as the four chums tumbled into
bed, though they did not speak of it, each one had
an uneasy feeling about Shambler. It was as if a
disrupting spirit had, somehow, crept into Randall.</p>

<p>If further evidence was needed of the pushing,
and self-interested spirit of Shambler the four
chums had it supplied to them a little later, at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
informal dance to which they were bidden at Fairview.</p>

<p>Tom and Phil came in from a walk one afternoon,
to find Sid and Frank eagerly waiting for
them in the room. No sooner had the two entered,
than Frank burst out with:</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows, open yours, and see if they
are the same as ours.”</p>

<p>“Open what?” asked Tom, looking about the
room. “You don’t mean to say some one has
sent me a prize package; do you?”</p>

<p>“Or maybe Moses has sent in to say that I
don’t need to study any more; that I’ve done so
well that I’m to be excused from all lectures, and
that my diploma is waiting for me,” spoke Phil
mockingly. “Don’t tell me that, fellows; remember
I have a weak heart.”</p>

<p>“It’s the invitations!” exclaimed Sid. “At
least I think that’s what they are. We got ’em,
and here are two letters&mdash;one for you, Tom, and
one for Phil. Come on, open ’em, and we’ll
answer, and go together.”</p>

<p>“Go where?” demanded Tom. “Say, what’s
this all about, anyhow? What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“They’re all excited over it,” added Phil.
“Like children.”</p>

<p>“Oh! for cats’ sake open ’em, and don’t keep
us waiting,” begged Frank, as he reached for two
envelopes that lay on the table. The missives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
unmistakably bore evidence of being “party bids,”
but Tom kept up the tantalizing tactics a little
longer, by turning his over from side to side, pretending
to scrutinize the postmark, and then ended
by gently smelling of the delicate perfume that
emanated from it.</p>

<p>“Smells good enough to eat,” he said, while
Phil was tearing his open.</p>

<p>“It’s an invitation all right,” remarked Ruth’s
brother. “The girls are to give a little dance
to-morrow night. Shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather!” exclaimed Sid quickly.</p>

<p>“Listen to him,” mocked Tom. “About a
year ago he would no more think of going where
the girls were than he would of taking in a lecture
on the dead Romans. But now. Oh shades
of Apollo! You can’t keep him home!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” exclaimed Sid.</p>

<p>“Humph!” mused Phil. “I suppose we <em>can</em>
go.”</p>

<p>“Sure; it’ll be fun,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p>“How about you, Tom?” asked Sid. “You’re
coming, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I was only joking,” and then Tom
went over to his bureau and began rummaging
among the contents of a certain drawer&mdash;contents
which were in all sorts of a hodge-podge.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Tom. “It’s gone!”</p>

<p>“What?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“That new tan-colored tie I bought last week.
It just matched my vest. Who took it?” and he
faced his chums.</p>

<p>“How dare you?” burst out Phil, with pretended
anger. “To accuse us, when there are so
many other guilty ones in Randall! How dare
you?”</p>

<p>“Come on, fork it over, whoever took it!”
demanded Tom. “Some of you have it. Caesar’s
side-saddles! A fellow can’t have anything decent
here any more! I’m going to have locks put
on my bureau!”</p>

<p>“What do you want of that tan-colored tie,
anyhow?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re the guilty one!” cried Tom.
“I’ll get it,” and he strode over to his chum’s
bureau, where, from a drawer, after a short
search, he pulled the missing tie.</p>

<p>“All crumpled up, too!” he exclaimed, as he
looked at it ruefully. “I’ll fix you for this, Sid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to muss it so. I just borrowed
it to wear the other night, and we got to
skylarking, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Skylarking with a girl!” cried Frank aghast.
“Say, you are going some, Sid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I only tried to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kiss her&mdash;I know,” went on Frank relentlessly.
“You ought to be given the ‘silence.’
But in view of the fact that there are mitigating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
circumstances, and that you wore another fellow’s
tie, we will suspend sentence. But don’t
let it occur again. Now about this glad-rag
affair.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” broke in Phil. “I don’t see why
Tom made such a fuss about that tie. He can’t
wear it to the dance, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Is it a full-dress affair?” asked
the owner of the tan scarf, as he carefully
smoothed it out.</p>

<p>“Sure it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then that’s different. I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>“And you bully-ragging me the way you did!”
reproached Sid. “Never mind. I still have some
friends left. But I’ll pay for having your little
new tie put in shape again, Tommy my boy. I’ll
buy you new inner tubes for it, and a shoe, and
you can have all the gasolene you want to make
it go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” retorted Tom, and he began
to rummage in his drawer once more.</p>

<p>“What now?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“My studs. I suppose some one has pinched
them.”</p>

<p>But no one had, and Tom’s sudden energy in
looking to see if he had all things needful for
the dance suggested to the others that they might
profitably do the same thing.</p>

<p>The invitations, which had come by special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
delivery, were put away with similar ones, and
other relics of good times in the past, and then
the boys began talking about the coming affair.
Lessons for the next day were not as well prepared
as usual, as might easily be imagined.</p>

<p>And the night of the dance! For the preserving
of the reputations of my heroes in particular,
and all young men in general I am not going to
give the details of the “primping” that went on
in the rooms of the four inseparables.</p>

<p>“It is simply disgraceful to see decent, well-behaved
and seemingly intelligent human beings
behave so,” Holly Cross remarked as he dropped
in when the four were getting into their “glad
rags.” He went on: “I never would have believed
it&mdash;never, if I had not seen it with my
own eyes.”</p>

<p>“Get out! You’re mad because you’re not
going,” said Tom, as he made up his white tie for
about the fifth time.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t so lower myself!” shot back
Holly, as he went out.</p>

<p>But at last the boys were ready, and, talk
about girls taking a long time to&mdash;well, but there,
I promised to say nothing about it. Anyhow, at
last they were off.</p>

<p>The dances at Fairview were always enjoyable
affairs, and this one was no exception. The girl
friends of our heroes were awaiting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope your cards aren’t all filled,” greeted
Tom.</p>

<p>“There is <em>one</em> dance left for each of you,”
spoke Madge Tyler, but her laughing eyes
stopped the protest that arose to Tom’s lips.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” he burst out, as he took
the program from her. Then a look showed him
that there were many vacant spaces which he proceeded
to fill. Madge laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>“Whose name was down here, that you rubbed
off?” demanded Tom suspiciously. Miss Tyler
blushed.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s some of your Randall manners,”
she burst out.</p>

<p>“Randall manners! What do you mean?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“A little while ago,” she explained, “just before
you boys came, I was standing near a pillar.
Someone came up behind me, and snatched my
program from my hand. Before I could stop
him he had scribbled his name down. But I
rubbed it out.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean a Randall man did that?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shambler.”</p>

<p>“That lout again!” murmured Tom. “I’ll
teach him a lesson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, don’t,” begged Madge. “I told him
what I thought of him myself.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Tom, and then he detailed
the circumstances to his chums. They
agreed that Jake Shambler would have to be
taught a severe lesson if his “freshness” did not
subside soon.</p>

<p>Not at all rebuffed by what had happened,
however, Shambler asked some of the other girls
in Miss Tyler’s set to dance with him, but they
refused. However he managed to find some
partners, including the girl who had invited him.
He greeted our heroes with breezy familiarity,
and they could do no less than bow coldly. But
Shambler did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>The dance went on, and the inseparables had a
fine time. Doubtless their girl friends did also,
and it was not until an early hour that the affair
ended.</p>

<p>“And to think that we won’t have another for
at least a month!” groaned Tom, as he and his
chums wended their way Randallward.</p>

<p>“And you’re the chap that was making such a
fuss about a tan tie,” murmured Sid. “Look at
yours now. There’s nothing left of it.”</p>

<p>“No, nor my collar either,” replied Tom, feeling
of his wilted linen, for he had danced much.</p>

<p>A week, in the early Spring, can work wonders.
One day there may be snow covering everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Then a few hours of warm sun, a warm South
wind, and it seems as if the buds were just ready
to burst forth.</p>

<p>So it was at Randall. The brown grass on the
campus began taking on a little hue of green.
There was a spirit of unrest in the air. Lectures
were cut in the most unaccountable way. Several
lads were seen out on the diamond wherefrom the
frost was hardly yet drawn. Balls began to be
tossed back and forth.</p>

<p>Down by the river, where, because of the sloping
land, it was dryer than elsewhere a little
group of lads were gathered about one of their
number.</p>

<p>“Now for a good one, Grasshopper!” someone
cried.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do seventeen or bust a leg!”
came the answer.</p>

<p>“What’s going on over there?” asked Tom
of his three chums, who were strolling about.</p>

<p>“Pete Backus is doing his annual Spring hop,”
said Phil.</p>

<p>“Let’s go watch him,” suggested Sid.</p>

<p>“He’s getting in training for the games,” declared
Frank. “I think I’ll enter myself if they
hold ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s been a lot of talk lately,” put in
Tom. “Exter Academy is hot for ’em, and I
understand Boxer Hall and Fairview would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in with us, on a quadruple league for the all-around
championship. But let’s look at Backus.”</p>

<p>“How much?” cried the long-legged lad as he
made his jump. “Did I beat my record?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen-nine,” announced a lad with a measuring
tape.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it seventeen!” declared Grasshopper.
“Oh, hello, Tom!” he cried. “Say, are you
going in for it?”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“The games&mdash;new league&mdash;didn’t you hear
about it?”</p>

<p>“No!” cried the quartette in a chorus.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s going to be great,” went on the lad
who imagined he was a jumper. “I’m going in
for the running broad, and maybe the high. I’m
practicing now.”</p>

<p>“Say, tell us about it,” begged Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing settled,” interposed Jerry
Jackson. “Some of the fellows are talking of
getting up a league for all-around athletics, and
I think it would be a good thing.”</p>

<p>“Is it only talk so far?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” replied Joe Jackson, the other Jersey
twin. “But there is going to be a preliminary
meeting in a few nights, and then it will be decided.
Are you fellows in for it?”</p>

<p>“We sure are!” cried the four friends.</p>

<p>The idea spread rapidly, and a few nights later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
there was a preliminary meeting in the Randall
gymnasium concerning the new league. Representatives
were present from Fairview, Boxer Hall
and Exter, and one and all declared themselves in
favor of something to open the season before the
baseball schedule had the call.</p>

<p>“What will you go in for, Tom?” asked Sid,
as the four inseparables were in their room after
the committee session.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I guess I won’t do much.
I’m going to save myself for the diamond. There’s
enough others to uphold the honor of Randall.
There are Frank, and Phil and you.”</p>

<p>“But we want a good representation. How
about the mile run for you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. Frank, you ought to go in for
the hammer throw, the shot put, and for the
weight throwing.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I will. I understand there are some
good lads at those sports at Boxer and Fairview.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and some here.”</p>

<p>“Shambler’s going to enter, I hear,” added
Phil.</p>

<p>“What for?” queried Sid.</p>

<p>“The mile run, and some jumping.”</p>

<p>“Well, he looks good, though I don’t exactly
cotton to him. Say, things will be lively here
soon,” commented Frank. “I guess I’ll begin
training.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better come in, Tom,” advised Sid.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll wait a while.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t about that trouble at home; is it?”
asked Sid in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Well, in a way, yes,” admitted Tom. “You
see I don’t know when I may have to leave here,
and it wouldn’t be just right to enter for a contest
and then have to drop out.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“It might be&mdash;there’s no telling.”</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Sid, and his voice took on a new
tone. “I think you ought to enter, and practice
up to the last minute. If you have to drop out,
of course, that’s a different matter. But I think
you ought to do your best.”</p>

<p>“Why? There are plenty of others. Why
should I?”</p>

<p>“Why? For the honor of Randall, of course.
You never were a quitter, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I’m not going to begin now,” finished
Tom with a smile. “I’ll enter the games, Sid.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THROUGH THE ICE</small></h2>


<p>“Shove over, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Say, what do you want, the whole sofa?”</p>

<p>“No, but give a fellow his share, can’t you?”
and Phil looked down on his chum, who was
sprawled over a goodly part of the ancient and
honorable article of furniture. “Sid has one
armchair, and Frank the other, and I want some
place to rest my weary bones,” declared Phil.
“I’ve been out with the natural history class after
bugs, and other specimens, and I’ll wager we
walked ten miles. Give me a place to rest.”</p>

<p>“Try the floor,” grunted Tom, who was too
comfortable to move. “What do you want to
come in for raising a row, just as we’re nice and
cozy?”</p>

<p>“Say, haven’t I a right here?” demanded Phil.
“Who helped fix that old sofa, I’d like to know,
when all its bones were showing? Give me a
whack at it, Tom.”</p>

<p>But Tom refused to budge, and presently, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the room of the four inseparables, there was a
scuffling sound, and the tall pitcher felt himself
being suddenly slewed around by the feet, until
there was room enough for another on the sofa.
But Phil did the gymnastic act too well, for he
shoved Tom a bit too far, and, a moment later
one hundred and fifty pounds more or less,
slumped to the floor with a jar.</p>

<p>“There, now you have done it!” cried Sid, as
he sprang from one of the easy chairs, and made
a grab for the fussy little alarm clock, that had
been jarred from its place on the table by the concussion
of Tom’s fall.</p>

<p>“Grab it!” yelled Frank.</p>

<p>“Safe!” ejaculated Sid, holding it up. “But it
was a close call. The next time you fellows want
to do the catch-as-catch-can, go out in the hall.
This is a gentleman’s resort, mind.”</p>

<p>“I’ll punch your head&mdash;if I think of it to-morrow,”
grumbled Tom, who had been half asleep
when Phil so unceremoniously awakened him.
“Remind me of it&mdash;somebody.”</p>

<p>“On your peril,” laughed Phil, as he grabbed
up some of the cushions which had fallen under
his chum, and made an easy place for himself
on the now vacant sofa. Tom continued to lie on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Anything doing outside when you came in?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not much. I stopped in the gym, and a lot of
the fellows were talking track athletics, and
Grasshopper was jumping.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if there’d be something doing this
Spring,” commented Frank. “I was talking to
Holly Cross, Kindlings and some of the others,
and there’s a good show for the new league. All
the other teams are hot for it. We’ve got to have
several more meetings though, and see if we can
get enough cash to buy the prizes, and arrange for
the meet.”</p>

<p>“Would it be held here on our grounds?” asked
Tom, showing a sudden interest.</p>

<p>“Well, some of the fellows want it here, and
Boxer Hall is going to make a strong bid for it,”
said Sid. “I think, and so does Kindlings, that
it ought to be on some neutral field.”</p>

<p>“I agree with Dan Woodhouse,” remarked
Frank, giving “Kindlings” his right name. “A
neutral field will be fair to all. Well, if this
weather keeps on we’ll be out practicing in a few
weeks.”</p>

<p>But, though the weather did not bear out the
promise of the first few warm days of Spring,
there was still plenty of practice. The enthusiasm
over a track meet grew, and many more lads
than were expected put in an appearance at the
gymnasium, to try out their skill over the hurdles,
vaulting the bar, in hundred yard dashes, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the weight, shot and hammer, while any number
said they were going to try to qualify for the
mile run, and the broad and high jumps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more or less correspondence went
on among the athletic committees of the four institutions
that naturally would form the new
league, if matters came to a head. Exter was
comparatively a new college, but she stood well
to the fore in athletics.</p>

<p>The end of the Winter was at hand, when one
night there came an unprecedented freeze. Tom
and his chums awakened shivering in their quarters,
for the window had been left open, and the
thermometer was away down.</p>

<p>“Wow! Somebody turn on the heat!” cried
Tom, poking his nose out from under the covers.</p>

<p>“It’s Phil’s turn,” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“It is not,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I’ll toss you for it, Sid,” put in Frank, leaping
out of bed, and reaching for his trousers to get a
coin. “Call!”</p>

<p>“Heads!” shouted Sid.</p>

<p>“It’s tails,” declared the big Californian.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, turn it on, like a good fellow, now
that you’re up,” advised Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I like your nerve!” ejaculated Frank
with a laugh, but, good naturedly, he did as he
was asked, and soon the radiator was thumping
and pounding away, while the boys waited a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
minutes longer before venturing out from under
the warm covers.</p>

<p>“There’ll be skating all right!” declared Tom,
as he breathed on the frosty window. “We’ll
have a last glide on Sunny River. Who’s for a
spin before breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Not for mine!” cried Phil, and none of the
others showed an inclination to stroll out in the
frosty air until necessary. Before chapel, however,
several of the lads paid a visit to the stream,
coming back with glowing reports of the smooth
ice.</p>

<p>“A hockey game this afternoon!” cried Tom,
after lectures, and scores of others agreed with
him.</p>

<p>“Not until some of you blue-jays do your turn
in the gym!” declared Kindlings and Holly Cross,
who had constituted themselves a sort of coaching
pair, pending the selection of a regular trainer for
the track games.</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton, the professional coach was temporarily
absent, and it was not known whether
he would be back in time to take charge of the
various squads or not.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you’re going to make us
practice, when it may be the last chance for a
skate?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I sure am,” replied Holly. “But we’ll cut it
short. Come on now, fellows, no backing out. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
got to the top of the heap at football and baseball,
and we don’t want to slump on the track.
Randall must be kept to the fore.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” came the cry, and the lads
piled off for the gymnasium, where they indulged
in some hard practice.</p>

<p>“That new fellow, Shambler, seems to be doing
some good jumping,” remarked Phil to Tom, as
the two were doing a little jog around the track.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wonder where’s he from, anyhow? I
never heard much about him while he was at
Harkness&mdash;I wonder if he really is from that
college?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. What difference does it make,
anyhow? Harkness was a small college, and her
records didn’t count. But Shambler sure can
jump. He’s as good at the high as he is at the
broad. There he goes for another try, and they’ve
got it up to the four-foot-ten mark I guess.”</p>

<p>“Four eleven,” remarked Phil, who could read
the marks on the standards. “If he does that
he’s a good one. The record is five feet seven.”</p>

<p>“There&mdash;he did it and a couple of inches over,”
cried Tom, as Shambler made a magnificent leap.
“Say, we need him all right.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I only wish he was a little more
companionable. He trains too much in with that
Boxer Hall sporting set, to suit me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, too bad. But it can’t be helped. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
he’s going to try the broad. Let’s watch him.”</p>

<p>Shambler came up to the take-off on the run,
and shot into the air. Forward like a stone from
a catapult he went and unable to recover himself
he crashed full into Tom, who was standing watching.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Shambler, as he hung on
to Tom to avoid falling. “What are you trying
to do, anyhow? Queer my jump? I’d have
broken my record, only for you!” He spoke in
angry tones.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” began Tom, “I didn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Looks as though you got there on purpose,”
interrupted the jumper, flashing a black look at
Tom. “Isn’t the gym big enough for you?”</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Tom, nettled at the tone.
“I said I was sorry for what I couldn’t help, and
that ought to be enough. I didn’t mean to get in
your way, and if I spoiled your jump&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You spoiled it all right,” broke out Shambler.
“Now I’ve got to try over again. Get back out
of the way!” he ordered to Tom and Phil, as
though they were the veriest freshmen, instead of
being upper-classmen.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;&mdash;” spluttered Tom, but Phil caught
him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Don’t say it,” he advised. “Let the cad alone.
If he’s like that, the sooner Randall knows it the
better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” answered Tom in a low voice,
swallowing his just wrath, and he swung aside.
Shambler tried the jump again, and, though he
did exceedingly well there was little applause for
him from the watching throng, for many of the
lads had heard what he said to Tom.</p>

<p>“There, I guess we’ve done our share!” exclaimed
Tom, after a bit. “Come on out on the
ice now, Phil, Sid and Frank have gone, and we
don’t want to get left on a hockey game.”</p>

<p>Sunny River was thronged with students, and
soon several games were in progress. A number
of the girls and boys from Fairview Institute
skated down, and among them was Phil’s sister
Ruth, and her three girl chums. Naturally Tom
and his three friends soon deserted the hockey
game to skate with the girls, not heeding the entreaties
of their companions.</p>

<p>“Let the lady killers go!” sneered Shambler,
who had taken his place in one of the games.
“We want sports in our crowd.”</p>

<p>“We must go home early,” said Ruth after a
bit. “We are to have a class meeting to-night,
and I’m one of the hostesses.”</p>

<p>“Strictly a girls’ party?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No boys allowed,” was the laughing answer,
and after some pleasantries the four girls started
up the frozen surface of the stream, their escorts
going down. The hockey games were over, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
many of the players had taken off their skates.
Turning to wave a farewell to Ruth and the
others, Tom saw a solitary lad skating near them.</p>

<p>“There’s Shambler,” he thought. “I guess
he’d like to do some lady-killing on his own account.
I hope the girls don’t get skating with
him.”</p>

<p>Tom, who had lingered a few moments, now
spurted ahead to catch up to his companions, who
were some distance in advance. He had almost
reached them when he was aware of some one
skating rapidly up behind him. He wheeled about
to behold Shambler, with a white, set face, coming
on like the wind. And, a second later, Tom heard
the screams of the girls and saw but two where, a
moment before, there had been four.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what happened?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“They&mdash;they went through the ice I guess!”
panted Shambler. “They were near me, and I
heard it crack. I&mdash;I skated away&mdash;I wanted to
get help. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You skated away!” thundered Tom. “Sid&mdash;Phil&mdash;fellows!
The girls are through the ice&mdash;an
air hole I guess&mdash;come on back! Shambler&mdash;Shambler
skated away!” he murmured under
his breath as he looked unutterable things at the
new lad. “Come on, boys!”</p>

<p>There was a ring of steel on ice. Four figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
turned and like the wind shot up the river, while
Tom, in the lead, shouted:</p>

<p>“We’re coming&mdash;we’re coming. To the rescue!
Keep away from the edge, girls!” He
wanted to warn back the two who had not fallen
in.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t swim,” murmured the white-faced
Shambler, as he kept on down the river. “I&mdash;I’ll
get a doctor.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>TOM KEEPS SILENT</small></h2>


<p>“Who is it? Who fell in?” gasped Phil, as he
gained a place at Tom’s side.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the strained answer, as
Tom gazed eagerly ahead to make out the figures
of the two girls, who, clinging together, stood
near the hole through which their companions had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see who they are?” went on Phil,
half piteously, appealing to his chums. “Is&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They knew what he meant, though he did not
finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“It can’t be Ruth,” said Tom softly. “Ruth
is standing there&mdash;with Madge Tyler.”</p>

<p>Yet, even as he spoke, he knew that it was not
so. For the two girls on the ice, frantically turning
to note the progress of the rescuing lads, disclosed
their faces to the hurrying quartette, and
it was seen that they were Mabel Harrison and
Helen Newton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ruth&mdash;Ruth is in the water!” gasped Phil,
for he too saw now that his sister was missing.</p>

<p>“And Miss Tyler!” added Frank.</p>

<p>Then, without another word, the four boys
skated on as they had never skated before, not
even when a race was to be won&mdash;or lost. Tom
gave a glance back, and saw Shambler heading for
the shore. A fierce wave of anger swept over him,
but he said nothing to his chums of the apparent
act of cowardice.</p>

<p>“Is she there? Holding on to the ice? Are
they both there, girls?” gasped Phil, as he covered
the intervening distance between himself and
the two frightened girls.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, hurry!” called Mabel. “They
are both holding on to the ice, but they can’t last
much longer. It’s cracking all the while. We
tried to go near, but it bends with us!”</p>

<p>“Keep back! Keep back!” shouted Tom.
“Don’t you two go in. Fence rails, fellows!
Fence rails are what we need!”</p>

<p>He and the others skated near enough to see
the two girlish figures in the water, clinging to the
ragged edges of the icy hole.</p>

<p>“Ruth! Ruth! Can you hold on a little
longer?” gasped Phil.</p>

<p>“Ye-e-e-s!” was the shivering answer.</p>

<p>“And you, Madge?” cried Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but be quick&mdash;as you can,” she said,
and her voice was faint.</p>

<p>“Off with our skates! Lay the rails on the ice
and they’ll support our weight!” cried Sid, catching
Tom’s idea, and leaping toward a fence on
shore.</p>

<p>It was done in a trice, and, a moment later several
long rails were stretched over the gaping
hole. This gave firm support, and willing hands
and sturdy arms soon raised the two dripping
figures from the ice-cold water. The girls all but
collapsed as they were dragged to safety.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with ’em?” asked Frank,
who, truth to tell, had hitherto had little to do
with girls.</p>

<p>“We must get them to some warm place at
once!” cried Tom. “There’s a house over there.
Mabel, you and Helen run over and tell ’em to
get the fires good and hot, and have plenty of
hot water. We’ll bring the girls over. Come
boys, off with our coats and wrap ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you’ll get c-c-c-cold!” protested
Madge.</p>

<p>“What of it?” cried Sid sharply, as he peeled
off his thick jacket and wrapped it around the
shivering girl. His companions covered Ruth,
and then Tom had an idea.</p>

<p>“Make a chair, fellows!” he cried. “A chair
with our hands, and two of us can carry each girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
It’s the quickest way. Their dresses are freezing
now.”</p>

<p>The tall pitcher’s plan was at once adopted.
Wrapped in the boys’ coats, the girls were lifted
up on the hands of the lads in the old familiar
fashion, and then the journey to the farmhouse
was begun, Mabel and Helen having preceded the
little party.</p>

<p>“Come right in!” invited an elderly woman as
she stood in the doorway. “We’ll soon have you
as warm as toast. You boys bring in some more
wood. Oh, it’s too bad! I’ll soon have some hot
lemonade for ’em. You must get your wet things
off, dearies.”</p>

<p>She was a motherly old soul, and with the
assistance of her daughter, and Mabel and Helen,
the half-drowned ones were soon fairly comfortable,
while generous potions of hot lemonade
warded off possible colds.</p>

<p>“It all happened so suddenly,” said Ruth when,
some little time later, her brother and his chums
were admitted to the room where the two girls
were wrapped in blankets, and sitting in big chairs
before a roaring fire. “We were skating on
when, all of a sudden, the ice gave way, and
Madge and I found ourselves in the water. Oh,
I thought we would come up under the ice, and
have to stay there until&mdash;&mdash;” She stopped with a
shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk about it, Ruth dear,” begged her
chum.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing the boys were so close,”
spoke Mabel. “They came like the wind, but,
even then, I thought they would never get there.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can go back to school?” ventured
Ruth.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” decided her brother. “You
must be kept good and warm, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, Phil dear, perhaps they haven’t room
here for us, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes we have,” interrupted the woman. “I’ve
plenty of spare beds. You just make yourselves
comfortable. Well, I declare, here comes Dr.
Nash,” and she looked out of the window as the
medical man, who had been summoned by Shambler,
walked in the front yard. The physician continued
the treatment already so well begun, and
said, with a good night’s sleep, the young ladies
would be none the worse off for the affair.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Mabel and Helen should
go back to Fairview, to report the accident, and
that Madge and Ruth should remain at the farmhouse
over night. The boys, after making sure
there was nothing more they could do, took their
leave.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was a mighty close call!”
gasped Phil, when they were once more skating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
toward Randall. “It gave me the cold shivers.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“How’d you come to see ’em fall in?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” replied Tom. “I&mdash;er&mdash;some one
told me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Shambler,” interposed Sid. “I wonder
why he didn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tom took a sudden resolve. It was within his
power then to break Shambler&mdash;utterly to destroy
his reputation among his fellow-students,
for there was no doubt but that the new lad had
acted the part of a coward. And, as Tom thought
of the mean actions of the fellow in the gymnasium
that afternoon, he was tempted to tell what he
knew. Randall was no place for cowards.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom seemed to see himself back in the room
with his chums. He saw them lolling on the old
sofa, or in the big chairs. He heard the ticking
of the fussy little alarm clock, and with that there
seemed to come to him a still, small voice, urging
him to choose the better way&mdash;the more noble
way.</p>

<p>“Shambler,” repeated Frank, “he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He saw us going to the rescue I guess,” put
in Tom quietly. “He saw that we could beat
him skating and he&mdash;he ran for the doctor. It
was&mdash;the wisest thing he could do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Phil. “I didn’t think of
that. I must thank Shambler when I see him.”</p>

<p>Tom kept silent, but he thought deeply, and he
knew that Phil’s thanks would be as dead-sea
apples to Shambler.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s hit it up,” proposed Frank.
“I’m cold.” And they skated on rapidly.</p>

<p>They were soon at Randall, where the story of
the rescue had preceded them, and they were in
for no end of congratulations and hearty claps
on the back.</p>

<p>“You fellows have all the luck,” complained
Holly Cross. “I never rescued a pretty girl yet.”</p>

<p>“No, Holly’s too bashful,” added Dutch Housenlager!
“He’d want to be introduced before
he saved her life.”</p>

<p>“Or else he’d pass over his card, to introduce
himself,” added Jerry Jackson. “Then he’d tell
her what college he was from, and want to know
whether she would have any serious objection to
being pulled from the icy H<span class="tinyfont">2</span>O by the aforesaid
Holly.”</p>

<p>“You get out!” cried the badgered one. “I
can save girls as well as anyone, only I never get
the chance.”</p>

<p>“You’re not quick enough,” suggested Dutch.
“You should be on the lookout to get a life-saving
medal. But, all joking aside, Tom, was it at all
serious?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sure was,” came the reply. “It looked to
be touch and go for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>On his way to the library that evening, to get
a book he needed in preparing his lessons, Tom
met Shambler. The athlete looked at our hero,
half shamefacedly, and asked:</p>

<p>“Are the&mdash;the girls all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tom shortly.</p>

<p>“I say, Parsons,” and Shambler’s voice had a
note of pleading in it. “I&mdash;I lost my head, I
guess. I was a coward, I know it. I&mdash;er&mdash;are
you going to tell?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” snapped Tom. “We&mdash;we
don’t tell&mdash;at Randall.”</p>

<p>He hurried on, not stopping to hear what
Shambler had to say&mdash;if anything&mdash;in the way of
thanks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>IN THE ICE BOAT</small></h2>


<p>“What can we do to have some fun?”</p>

<p>“Stand on your head.”</p>

<p>“Go off by yourself to a moving picture show.”</p>

<p>“You’re a whole circus yourself.”</p>

<p>It was Dutch Housenlager who had asked the
question, and it was Tom Parsons and his chums
who had made answers, for Dutch had invaded
the precinct of their room in search of amusement,
to the detriment of the studious habits of our
friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, say now, be decent, can’t you?” pleaded
Dutch. “I’m in earnest.”</p>

<p>“So are we,” declared Tom. “We aren’t all
geniuses like you, Dutch. We have to study in
order to know anything, but we can’t if you come
here, begging to be amused.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do something&mdash;or bust,” declared
the fun-loving lad in desperation.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to blow up, please go outside,”
invited the big Californian solemnly. “It messes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
up a room horribly to have a fellow like you
scattered all over it. Get outside!”</p>

<p>“You brute,” murmured Dutch. “After all
I’ve done to add to the gaiety of Randall.”</p>

<p>“Work off another ink catapult on a new teacher,”
advised Tom. “That’s always good for a
laugh.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” urged Dutch, for that was a
sore point with him yet, though it had happened
some weeks before.</p>

<p>It was now several days since the rescue of the
girls, and they had suffered no permanent ill effects
from their break through the ice. Phil and
his chums had seized on the excuse of asking about
them, to pay several visits to Fairview, until
Miss Philock, the aged preceptress “smelled a
mouse,” as Sid said, and curtailed the visits of all
but Phil, who, by virtue of being a brother, was
allowed to see Ruth for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“But what’s the fun of going to see your own
sister?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“What indeed?” echoed the others, though
some of them wished they were Phil.</p>

<p>And, as the days wore on the cold did not diminish,
and the ice on the river held.</p>

<p>“A slim outlook for Spring games,” growled
Dutch, as he sat in the chums’ room, vainly begging
a suggestion for fun.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, warm weather will come, sooner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
later,” declared Tom with a yawn, flinging a book
behind the ancient couch. “How are things working
out?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good, I guess,” replied Dutch. “Holly
and Kindlings have charge of the arrangements.
It’s practically decided that we’ll be one of a
four-sided league. The only point is that of deciding
what events to put on the program. Some
want one, and some another.”</p>

<p>“Think Randall has any chance?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Sure,” declared Dutch. “Shambler is showing
up well in the runs, and Frank here is jumping
his head off, and going some with the shot
and hammer. You fellows want to perk-up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s time enough,” remarked Tom.
“So Shambler is doing good work; eh?”</p>

<p>“Fine. I didn’t think he could. Some of the
fellows seemed to think he had a yellow streak in
him, but it isn’t showing, and I don’t believe it
will.”</p>

<p>And then, it came to Tom, more forcibly than
ever, that Shambler did have a yellow streak in
him&mdash;the yellow streak of cowardice.</p>

<p>“And if it comes out at the last minute, it will
be bad for Randall,” thought Tom. “But I
promised to keep still, and I will. If anything
happens&mdash;well, the rest of us will have to make
it up, and cover it&mdash;for the honor of Randall.”</p>

<p>“Oh I say. I can’t stand this!” cried Dutch at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
length. “I’m getting the blues. Come on out,
fellows. I’ve got a surprise for you. I’ve been
holding it up my sleeve, thinking you’d suggest
something, but, as long as you haven’t, I’m going
to spring something. Chuck the books!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Sid, glancing up in anticipation.</p>

<p>“Come on out on the river,” urged Dutch.
“It’s early yet, and I guess Zane won’t make a
fuss if we ask him for a little time off. We’re
all standing well in classes, thank fortune.”</p>

<p>“The river!” yawned Frank. “I’ve had
enough of skating for to-day.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t skating,” declared Dutch. “Come on.
I’ll guarantee you a surprise and some fun, or
you need never trust me again. It’s a fine moonlight
night&mdash;as nice as when we went coasting that
time. Come on!”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Tom. “No skylarking
with the Spring exams so near.”</p>

<p>“Nothing worse than usual,” guaranteed
Dutch. “Be sports, and come on before the wind
dies out.”</p>

<p>“Wind! Are you going to fly kites?” asked
Sid.</p>

<p>“Something like it. Listen. A fellow up the
river has built a home-made ice boat. I saw him
at it when he started, and gave him a pointer or
two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the first I knew you were an expert
on ice boats,” chimed in Phil.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” admitted Dutch frankly, “but he
thought I was, and it was all the same. He
adopted my ideas, and the fun of it is that the
boat goes like a charm. He said I could take it
any night I wanted to, and I’m going to borrow it
now. We’ll have a sail under the moon, and blow
some of the cobwebs out of our brain.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s all to the ham sandwich!” cried
Tom. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“If Zane will let us go,” added Sid.</p>

<p>The proctor, after a show of hesitation, yielded
and soon the five students were walking along the
edge of the frozen river.</p>

<p>The owner of the home-made ice yacht readily
gave Dutch permission to use it, and soon the
boys had slid it out on the frozen stream and prepared
to hoist the sail.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to run it?” asked Tom of
Dutch.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. Didn’t I help build it? All
you have to do is to hoist the sail and steer. You
can’t go wrong.”</p>

<p>“All right, you do it then,” directed Sid. “I’d
be sure to have an upset.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy,” boasted Dutch. “Pile on.”</p>

<p>“Well, stop it. Wait for a fellow!” cried Phil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for the craft was even now moving slowly off before
the breeze.</p>

<p>“Hop on!” ordered Dutch. “You can’t stop
this like an auto, you know. Pile on while it’s
moving.”</p>

<p>They managed to, somehow, and then, with
Dutch at the helm, and to manage the sail, they
darted off.</p>

<p>Now, if the truth is to be told, Dutch knew
about as much of how to manage an ice boat as a
Hottentot would about running a locomotive, but
the Randallite was not going to admit that.</p>

<p>“I can sure sail up the river, for the wind is
blowing that way,” he reasoned with himself.
“And if it doesn’t switch around, and blow us
back again, we can walk, and I’ll tell the fellows
something has busted.”</p>

<p>Soon the ice boat began to move faster and
faster.</p>

<p>“How’s this?” demanded Dutch proudly.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Sid. “I never knew you could
sail one of these things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t go about telling all I know,” remarked
Dutch modestly.</p>

<p>“How do you steer?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Same as in a sailboat,” replied the helmsman.
“When you want to go to the left you shove this
handle over this way, and the opposite way to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to the right. See,” and he moved the tiller to
one side.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a mix-up, the boat suddenly
overturned and five figures sprawled out on the
ice, while the craft turned around as if on a
point, the sail banging in the wind.</p>

<p>“Is&mdash;is that the way you always steer?” asked
Phil sarcastically, “or was this just a special
method, invented for our amusement?”</p>

<p>“This is his regular way,” declared Tom, rubbing
his elbows. “It must be.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I turned too short,” stammered
Dutch. “I can do better next time. Let’s right
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have any ‘next time,’” urged Frank.
“Just sail straight away, if it’s all the same to
you. Hold on there!” he cried as the boat showed
an inclination to go off by herself. “Whoa!”</p>

<p>“That’s no way to talk to an ice boat,” insisted
Sid. “You should say ‘Gee-haw!’”</p>

<p>“Say, I know how to manage her all right,” declared
Dutch. “Come on now, get on, and we’ll
go on up the river.”</p>

<p>Somewhat less confident of their friend’s ability
than at first, the boys piled on, and once more
they were off. For a time all went well. The ice
was smooth and hard, and the breeze powerful
enough to send them along at a kiting pace. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as they came opposite Fairview institute, Tom
had an idea.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a chance, and call for the girls,”
he said. “The ogress can’t do more than turn
us down, and she may let them come out for a
spin.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” agreed Phil and the others.</p>

<p>“Can you stop this shebang?” asked Frank,
of Dutch.</p>

<p>“Stop it? Of course I can. I’ll land you on
shore at any spot you say.”</p>

<p>“Then put us up by the boat dock, and you can
wait there until we come back. Shall we bring
you a girl?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” was the indignant answer. “I’ve
got troubles enough to manage this boat. It’s
crankier than I thought it was.”</p>

<p>Dutch put the helm over, with the intention of
steering for the shore. At that moment two figures
were seen walking along on the surface of
the frozen river, and the form of one of the figures
was vaguely familiar to the boys.</p>

<p>“Look out! Don’t run into them,” cautioned
Tom.</p>

<p>“No danger,” declared Dutch. “I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re heading right for ’em!” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll clear ’em all right,” asserted the
steersman. “Just you fellows sit steady and watch
your uncle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in spite of his efforts, the ice boat seemed
to be bearing down straight on the two figures.
They halted, hesitated for a moment, and then
prepared to run out of danger.</p>

<p>“It’s a lady!” cried Sid.</p>

<p>A scream bore out his assertion.</p>

<p>“Miss Philock, or I’m a sinner!” ejaculated
Tom.</p>

<p>The moon came out from behind a rift of
clouds, throwing the figures into bold relief.</p>

<p>“Look out where you’re going!” warned a
man’s voice.</p>

<p>“Pitchfork!” gasped Sid in a hoarse whisper.
“Our Latin professor!”</p>

<p>“And look who he’s with!” added Frank.</p>

<p>Down bore the ice boat on the two, like a juggernaut
of fate.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh mercy!” screamed Miss Philock, as
she saw the danger.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to run us down!” cautioned
Mr. Tines imperiously.</p>

<p>“Tom&mdash;Sid, lend me a hand with this rudder!”
cried Dutch. “It’s jammed!”</p>

<p>The three students tried in vain to change the
course of the craft. Nearer and nearer it came
to the luckless two, who were on the frozen river.
There was a scream of fear, a chorus of angry
cautions, and then the ice boat struck.</p>

<p>The feet of Professor Tines went gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from under him, and he sat down on the very bow
of the ice boat, clinging to a mast stay. As for
Miss Philock, she was struck by one of the runners,
tossed into the air, and came down in the
blanket-padded cockpit, fortunately striking none
of the boys.</p>

<p>Then, with a lurch the boat slewed around, and
headed for shore. A moment later, being unguided,
she seemed to change her mind, and did
a sort of waltz and two-step combined. Next,
with a sharp swing, the craft turned gracefully on
her side, and there was a splintering sound as the
mast snapped, and the sail came down, like a
blanket over all.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>A MISSING PICTURE</small></h2>


<p>“This is an outrage! It was done purposely!
I shall demand severe punishment for the perpetrators
of it!”</p>

<p>Thus exclaimed Professor Emerson Tines, his
voice half smothered under the sail of the ice boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has happened? Are we sinking?
Are we going through the ice?” cried Miss Philock.</p>

<p>It was almost beyond the power of the lads to
give any adequate description of what had happened,
so rapidly had events shaped themselves.
Tom managed to crawl out of the tilted cockpit.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” he said, in his best manner, as
he extended his hand to help up Miss Philock.</p>

<p>“Oh! Are you sure there’s no danger?” she
asked, hesitating to trust herself to him. “Is
there a hole in the ice?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” Tom assured her. “Unfortunately
we ran you down with the ice boat, but
I trust you are not hurt.”</p>

<p>Just then Phil managed to scramble out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
tangle of sail and mast, and his face was revealed
in the moonlight. Miss Philock knew him for
the brother of one of her charges.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Clinton!” she cried. “I never
would have believed it of you!”</p>

<p>“An accident, I do assure you,” interposed Phil.
“It could not be helped. I hope you are not
hurt, Professor Tines.”</p>

<p>“Hurt! Humph! Little you care whether I
am or not. I shall report you to Dr. Churchill
as soon as I reach college. It is scandalous!”</p>

<p>The Latin teacher managed to scramble to his
feet, ignoring the proffered hand of Phil. Sid,
Frank and Dutch managed to crawl out from under
the ice boat.</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Dutch, looking at the
broken mast.</p>

<p>“I thought you said you could steer,” growled
Frank.</p>

<p>“I could, only the rudder got jammed. It
wasn’t my fault. Wow! This is tough!”</p>

<p>By this time Tom had assisted Miss Philock to
the shore, and Professor Tines, seeing the lady,
whom it developed later, he had been escorting
from a lecture, hastened to join her.</p>

<p>“I trust you have suffered no injuries,” he said.</p>

<p>“No. And you, Professor Tines?” she asked,
and Tom fancied there was a note of anxiety in
her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh I am all right, except that I am very much
upset over this annoyance.”</p>

<p>“I fancy we all were,” said Miss Philock, with
better grace than Tom had dared hoped she
would show. “It was an accident.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” said the Latin
teacher grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was, I assure you!” broke in Dutch
earnestly. “I couldn’t work the rudder. We&mdash;we
didn’t mean to do it.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, during which
the boys looked first at the damaged and overturned
ice boat, and then at the figures of the
professor, and the lady teacher of Fairview.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I think we had better be getting on,
Mr. Tines,” the lady said, at length. “It is getting
late.”</p>

<p>It was a gentle hint, and he took it.</p>

<p>“I shall see you young gentlemen later,” said
the professor significantly, as he started up the
river bank with Miss Philock.</p>

<p>“And it’s us for a walk back,” spoke Tom
slowly, when they had remained in silence for
about a minute. “Dutch, we are much obliged
for your evening of pleasure,” he added sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it all, I didn’t mean&mdash;&mdash;” began the
fun-loving lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it! Of course it wasn’t your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fault,” broke in Sid. “Come on. Let’s haul the
boat up on shore, and hoof it back. We can explain
to Zane.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for themselves our friends had held
good records of late, and the proctor did not
question them too closely, as they drifted in some
time after the locking-up hour. They told of the
accident, but did not mention Mr. Tines and his
companion.</p>

<p>“We’ll just hold that in reserve,” decided
Tom. “Fancy him being out with Miss Philock!”</p>

<p>Probably the walk back to Randall from Fairview
gave Professor Tines a chance to change his
views regarding the happening of the night. For,
though he looked rather grimly at our heroes in
chapel the next morning, he said nothing, and
there was no official report of the occurrence, for
which Tom and his chums were duly thankful.</p>

<p>“Pitchfork is more of a gentleman than we
gave him credit for,” he declared. “We each
have something to hold over him in reserve, for I
don’t believe he’d like the story told broadcast.”</p>

<p>Dutch and the others clubbed together to pay
for the damage to the ice boat, and the owner said
they could use it as often as they wished. But
there was no more chance that Winter for Spring
came with a rush after that last big freeze, and
there were no more cold weather sports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Now indeed did the talk turn to ball games, and
track athletics. The latter had the call, for it
was something new for Randall, and the other
institutions of learning that formed the four-sided
league.</p>

<p>Several committee meetings were held, and a
more or less tentative program was made up.
Available material was talked of, and every day
saw more and more candidates in the gymnasium,
out on the cinder path, or in the hammer circle.</p>

<p>“Have you any line of what Boxer Hall is doing?”
asked Tom of Dan Woodhouse one afternoon,
when a number of the lads were gathered
in the reading room of the gymnasium after some
hard practice.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re going strong,” replied Kindlings.
“But if we all keep on the job here at
Randall, and do our best, I think we can win.
But every fellow has got to do his best.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Sid.</p>

<p>“Are Langridge and Gerhart entered?” Frank
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Yes; both of ’em. But don’t let that worry
you. There are others at Boxer Hall more to
be feared than those two. I tell you we’re not
going to have a walkover. Exter is going to
show up strong, too, for a new college.”</p>

<p>A group of lads were gathered about a table
on which were several sporting papers, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a number of photographs of athletes, and
showing scenes at various meets.</p>

<p>“I tell you fellows what it is,” put in Shambler,
who seemed to have gotten very much at home in
the few weeks he had been at Randall, “practice
is the only thing that will help us win the championship.
I know, for I’ve been through the mill.
We’ve got to practice more.”</p>

<p>“Did you do it at Harkness?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, some, but I’ve trained by myself a lot,”
and there was a trace of boastfulness in his voice.
“I’m going to make the mile run,” he added.</p>

<p>“And win?” asked Sid, half sarcastically, turning
over a pile of papers.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Shambler. “I&mdash;er&mdash;” Suddenly
he reached out and picked a paper from
amid the pile. He seemed to be nervously folding
it in his hands. “I used to be a good runner,”
he went on, “and there’s no reason why I can’t
do as well again. I think I’d rather do that
than be in the high or broad jump. But of
course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All the candidates will have a try-out,” put
in Kindlings. “The best one wins, and he ought
to be willing to do the best that’s in him for
Randall.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” assented Shambler, and he
seemed glad of the interruption, still nervously
folding the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later he left the room rather
hurriedly, and, some time after that, Phil began
looking through the pile of illustrated papers for
a certain one.</p>

<p>“It was here a while ago,” he said to Kindlings.
“I wanted to show you how they had the hurdles
arranged at the last intercollegiate meet in New
York. It’s a good idea I think. Where the mischief
is that paper?”</p>

<p>“Which one?” asked Tom, who was reading
a book on training rules.</p>

<p>“The one Shambler was looking at. Oh, here
he comes now. What’d you do with that sporting
paper, Shambler?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;that paper&mdash;here it is,” and he
pulled it from his pocket. “Guess I stuck it there
by mistake.”</p>

<p>He tossed it over, and turned into the billiard
room, with a backward glance at the lads who
were now bending over the pages of the journal.</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean,” went on Phil, pointing
to an illustration. “Hello, the page is torn. It
wasn’t a while ago.”</p>

<p>“What’s on the other side?” asked Kindlings
half curiously.</p>

<p>“Some baseball nine&mdash;I can’t read all the
name&mdash;it’s some professional team,” replied Phil,
“and one of the players is missing&mdash;torn off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Well, never mind, you can see the hurdles, though.
I think we might use that kind at our meet.”</p>

<p>Then the two fell to talking of various forms
of athletic apparatus, eventually tossing the paper
aside. Tom picked it up when his two friends had
gone in to have a game of pool.</p>

<p>“That page wasn’t torn before Shambler
picked this paper up,” mused our hero. “I wonder
what his object was?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE WAY OF A MAID</small></h2>


<p>“Who’s it from, Phil?”</p>

<p>“Let’s read it; will you?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t dare?”</p>

<p>These comments greeted the advent of Phil into
the room of the inseparables, after a late lecture,
one day about a week following the events narrated
in the last chapter. The cause was a pink
envelope that was exposed in a prominent place on
Phil’s bureau&mdash;an envelope flanked by a comb,
brush, a handkerchief box and a red tie, to be
thus rendered all the more conspicuous. Tom,
Sid and Frank, having entered the room ahead of
their chum, and seeing the missive, had thus called
his attention to it.</p>

<p>“What’s all the excitement?” asked Phil innocently
enough.</p>

<p>“As if he didn’t know!” jeered Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a quarter if you let me read it
first,” offered Frank.</p>

<p>“Double it!” cried Sid promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a letter,” spoke Phil, as he strode
over to his bureau and picked up the missive.
Then, with provoking slowness, he turned it over,
scrutinized the postmark, looked at the dainty
seal in wax, and made as if to place the letter back
on the bureau.</p>

<p>“Open it you rascal!” ordered Tom.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Phil slowly. “It’s only
a letter from sis. It will keep until I get my coat
off, I guess.”</p>

<p>“A letter from your sister&mdash;not!” declared
Sid. “I&mdash;er&mdash;I know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know her writing as well as all that,
do you?” asked Phil quickly. “I congratulate
you. Maybe I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>Once more he scrutinized the address. It bore
his name in big, and rather sprawling characters.</p>

<p>“On second thoughts I guess it isn’t from sis,”
he went on. “At least she didn’t direct the envelope.
It’s from Madge Tyler, if I’m any
judge.”</p>

<p>“What’s she writing about?” Tom wanted to
know quickly, so quickly that the others glanced
at him, and Tom had the grace to blush.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” went on Phil. Then, with exasperating
slowness he proceeded to read the letter.
Next he carefully folded it, placed it back in the
envelope, and proceeded to get into his lounging
garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well?” snapped Tom, unable to keep silent
longer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know whether you fellows will be
interested or not,” said Phil slowly. “The letter
was from my sister, just as I guessed, but she got
Madge to direct the envelope.”</p>

<p>“But what’s it about?” demanded Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, the annual May walk, which takes place
the last of April, is about to be held at Fairview,”
went on Phil, “and sis thought maybe I’d like to
go with her.”</p>

<p>“You?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Take your own sister?” added Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, unless some one else relieves me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will!” cried Frank and Sid together.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Phil. “Then I guess I can
help some other brother out. But, say, do you
fellows want to go? Sis said I could ask you all.
It’s the usual affair, you know. The young ladies
of Fairview, under the eagle eye of Miss Philock
and her aides, will go for a May walk, to gather
flowers and look on nature as she is supposed to
be. There will be a little basket lunch, and the
usual screams when the girls think they see a
snake. Want to go?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried Tom, and the others chorused
an eager assent.</p>

<p>“It will be a good time then, to ask the girls to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
come to the athletic meet,” said Sid. “They will
come; won’t they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so,” replied Phil. “They won’t
root for Randall, though, when there’s going to
be a team from their own school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t expect it,” said Tom. “But
we’ll have a good time on the May walk.” And
forthwith he proceeded to look over his stock of
neckties.</p>

<p>Not many at Randall were favored as were our
four heroes in the matter of invitations to the May
walk, and when it became known that Tom and his
chums had one of the coveted screeds, their good
offices were bespoken on all sides, that they might
use their influence for others.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” replied Tom to Holly Cross,
Kindlings, and a few other kindred spirits.
“Sorry, but we can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“And the nerve of Shambler,” said Sid one afternoon,
as he joined his chums. “He wanted to
know if we couldn’t introduce him to some new
girl at Fairview. The one he did know, shook
him.”</p>

<p>“He’s getting worse all the while,” declared
Tom. “There is something about that fellow that
I can’t cotton to.”</p>

<p>“But he’s a good runner and jumper,” declared
Phil.</p>

<p>“Altogether too good,” declared Tom. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
he did as well at Harkness, as he’s doing here in
practice, why did he leave?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he wanted to get in a bigger college.”</p>

<p>“Harkness isn’t much smaller than Randall,
and it’s got a heap sight more money. He could
have stayed on if he had wanted to,” and Tom
shook his head. Two or three things in regard
to Shambler recurred to him, and he found himself
seriously wondering whether or not there was not
some mystery about the new student.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I guess I’m getting too fussy,”
decided Tom. “I must see about getting my
trousers pressed for that walk.”</p>

<p>Somewhat informally among themselves, the
four lads had apportioned the four girls. Tom
was to take Madge, Phil would escort Helen Newton,
Sid would take Ruth Clinton, and Frank
Simpson would look after Mabel Harrison. This
pleased the lads, but they had yet to ask the girls
if this arrangement suited. To Tom was delegated
this task, and one afternoon he set off with
three notes, his own to be a verbal message.</p>

<p>The choice had fallen on his shoulders as he
had the last lecture period free, and could make
time to go to Fairview. It was with rather pleasant
feelings that our hero took the trolley to the
co-educational institution, and, when he neared the
place, as it was such a fine day, he got out about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
a mile from his destination, deciding to walk the
rest of the way.</p>

<p>As Tom turned down a grassy lane, that was
rich in a carpet of green, he heard, coming from a
clump of bushes just ahead of him, a cry of pain&mdash;a
cry in a girl’s voice.</p>

<p>“Some one’s in trouble!” Tom decided at once,
and, naturally he hurried to the rescue. He saw,
reaching up that she might pull a large cocoon
from a high bush, a pretty girl, a stranger, but
who bore unmistakably the air of a Fairview student.
In an instant Tom saw what the trouble
was.</p>

<p>The bush was one containing big thorns, and,
in reaching for the cocoon, the girl’s arm had
caught on a sharp point. She was held by her
sleeve in such a way that either to advance her
arm, or withdraw it, meant to further pierce her
flesh with the thorn.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, and then Tom came on the
scene.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help you,” he said, with a lifting
of his hat. “Do you want the cocoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, but don’t mind that now! If you
can break off the thorn, so I can get my arm
out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A spasm of pain passed over her face, and Tom
acted quickly. He wore heavy gloves, but the
thorns pierced even through them. But he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not mind, and soon had broken away the offending
branch, not before, however, the girl, in moving
her arm, had inflicted a long scratch that bled
freely.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she murmured, and she reeled a bit as
she stepped back. “I&mdash;I can’t bear the sight of
blood!” she added.</p>

<p>Tom caught her, or she might have fainted, and
then, being a lad of promptness, he quickly bound
his handkerchief around the scratch.</p>

<p>“If you will sit down here, I think I can get
some water over at that house,” he went on. “It
will make you feel better.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she began, “it is such a bother&mdash;I’m so
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Tom hastened to assure her, and
in a little while he was back with a glass of water.
It did make the girl feel better, and, presently,
she arose.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, now, thank you,” she murmured,
as she walked along. Tom watched her narrowly.
“I ought to have worn gloves, or else have
brought along a pair of scissors,” she went on.
“We have to do some work in the natural history
class, and that’s why I wanted the cocoon. I’m at
Fairview,” she needlessly added.</p>

<p>“I’m on my way there,” spoke Tom. “My
name is Parsons. Ruth Clinton’s brother and
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard about you,” the girl interrupted
with a smile that Tom thought was very
attractive. “Ruth was telling me about you.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” laughed Tom, and then he
caught sight of the cocoon that had been the cause
of all the trouble. “Wait, I’ll get it for you,” he
volunteered, and he did though he scratched himself
grievously on the thorns.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk on with you,” he said, as he rejoined
the girl. “I have a note for Ruth.”</p>

<p>“I’m Miss Benson,” said the girl, simply. “I
am sure I can’t thank you enough, and I feel as if
I already knew you.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Tom, wondering how it was
he got along so well with girls, when he never
before had been used to them.</p>

<p>They walked on, talking of many things&mdash;and
the May outing. The main entrance of Fairview
loomed in sight.</p>

<p>“What shall I do about your handkerchief, Mr.
Parsons?” asked Miss Benson. “I’m afraid if I
take it off now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She started to do so, but at the sight of a little
blood trickling down her wrist she shuddered.</p>

<p>“Keep it on,” advised Tom. “You can send
it to me later. Perhaps you had better have a
doctor look at the scratch. It may need treatment.
Some of those thorns are poisonous.”</p>

<p>Instinctively he leaned over and began tightening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the handkerchief on the girl’s wrist. He
was engaged in this rather delicate task when,
from behind a clump of shrubbery, stepped four
maids. In an instant Tom knew them for Phil’s
sister and her three chums. They regarded him
and his companion curiously.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;it’s Tom!” exclaimed Ruth impulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes. He&mdash;he helped me out of a bad predicament,”
explained Miss Benson. “I was caught
on a thorn bush. I’ve scratched my wrist dreadfully,
girls.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Miss Tyler, rather blankly,
and Tom thought it was strange that none of the
girls seemed to take much interest in Miss Benson’s
injury. She herself smiled at Tom, and then
said:</p>

<p>“I’ll go along now, to the infirmary. I’m <em>so</em>
much obliged to you. I’ll send the handkerchief
back. It was so fortunate for me that I met you.”</p>

<p>“She generally manages to meet <em>somebody</em>,”
murmured Miss Harrison, and Tom wondered
more than ever as he lifted his hat in farewell.</p>

<p>“How are you?” greeted Tom, to Ruth and
the others. “I’m a sort of special messenger to-day.”</p>

<p>He pulled out his letters&mdash;one for Ruth, one
for Mabel, and one for Helen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“None for me?” asked Madge, in mock distress.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I came in person,” spoke Tom in a
low voice, as he saw that the others were perusing
the epistles that formally besought the company
of the young ladies on the May walk.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;&mdash;” began Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>“May I have the honor of escorting you on the
outing?” asked Tom, laughing to take out the
formality of his request.</p>

<p>Miss Madge Tyler looked at him a moment.
Then her gaze seemed to wander toward the retreating
form of Miss Benson. Tom waited, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said Madge, a bit stiffly, “but
I&mdash;am already engaged,” and she turned aside,
while Tom swallowed hard.</p>

<p>Clearly he was but beginning to know the way
of a maid.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>IN BITTER SPIRITS</small></h2>


<p>“Come on, Tom, aren’t you going to tog up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, get a move on, we don’t want to be late.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see the new tie you bought.”</p>

<p>Thus did the tall pitcher’s chums address him
as they circled about the all too small room when
it came to the pinch of all four dressing at once,
and that in their best outfits, which indicated an
occasion of more than usual importance.</p>

<p>But Tom was not dressing. In his most comfortable,
which is to say his oldest garments, he
lounged on the rickety old sofa, with a book in
his hand, and a novel at that.</p>

<p>But he was not reading, a fact which a close
observer could have at once detected, only there
were no close observers in evidence that pleasant
afternoon&mdash;the afternoon of the May walk of
Fairview.</p>

<p>Tom glanced from time to time at the printed
page but he saw nothing of the words. Instead,
there came between him and the types, the vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of a girl’s face&mdash;an imperious face now, with eyes
that looked coldly at him.</p>

<p>“Say, you’ll be late!” warned Phil, “and we’re
not going to wait for you. You’ll have to save
your own bacon.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;all right,” grumbled Tom, in tones he
meant to be deceiving. “No use of any more trying
to dress in this bandbox. I can throw my
things on in a jiffy when you fellows get out of
the way.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him,” taunted Sid.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s got a whole new outfit,” declared
Frank, “and he daren’t show ’em. Come on&mdash;be
a sport!”</p>

<p>“Um,” mumbled Tom, as he turned once more
to the book&mdash;but not to read.</p>

<p>“Where’s my hair brush?” demanded Phil.
“If any of you fellows&mdash;Well the nerve of you,
Sid!” he cried. “Using it on your shoes!”</p>

<p>“They’re patent leathers, and I only wanted to
get a little dust off ’em,” pleaded the guilty one.</p>

<p>“Hand it over!” sternly ordered Phil. “And
don’t you take it again. Use your pocket handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“Who’s seen my purple cuff buttons?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got ’em. I saw Wallops the messenger
with a pair like ’em the other day, though,”
spoke Sid. “Wear the blue ones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will not! I got the purple ones to match my
tie. Oh, here they are. I put ’em in my Latin
grammar to mark a page. Say, it’s lucky I remembered.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky some of you remember you’ve got
heads,” half growled Tom. “I never saw such
old maids! Don’t some of you want me to dab a
little red on your cheeks?”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, and come on, you old Iambus,”
grunted Phil&mdash;grunted because he was stooping
over to lace his shoes. “Aren’t you coming,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Of course. But I want room to dress. You
fellows clear out, and I’ll follow soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the clothes brush?” demanded Frank,
who was the nearest ready. “Say, there’s enough
dust in this room to stock a vacuum cleaner.
Whew!”</p>

<p>“The rug needs taking up and beating,” commented
Sid.</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Phil. “If we got it up it
would fall apart, and we’d never get it down
again. Let well enough alone. There, I guess
I’m finished. How do I look?”</p>

<p>“Like one of the advertisements of college-built
clothes from a back-woods tailor,” said Tom.
“You’re too sweet to live! You’ll have all the
girls crazy about you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re jealous,” was the retort. “Get a move
on, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sit down and take it easy,” advised Sid,
who was struggling with a new tie in a stiff collar.
“Whew! This is fierce. I can’t make it slide.”</p>

<p>“Put it out on first then,” advised Tom with a
grin.</p>

<p>Finally the three were arrayed to their own satisfaction,
and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>“Shall we wait for you outside?” asked Phil of
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, go on, get a car. I’ll follow. I want to
finish this chapter. There’s loads of time. You’re
too early. Sit down and cool off.”</p>

<p>“What, and get all dust! I guess not!” cried
Sid. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>“See you later?” asked Phil, as he went out.</p>

<p>“Later&mdash;yes,” replied Tom, pretending to
yawn and stretch, as though the whole affair bored
him. And then, as the door closed, and he heard
his chums walking down the corridor, he threw the
book across the room, leaned forward with his
head between his hands, his elbows on his knees,
and gave way to bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>For Tom Parsons was not going on the May
walk.</p>

<p>Many besides our three friends had fearfully,
and more or less wonderfully, arrayed themselves
that afternoon for the annual outing, and soon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
roads seemed to be leading to Fairview. Sid,
Phil and Frank were among the earliest arrivals,
and soon found Ruth, Mabel and Helen, who
were waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Where’s Tom?” asked Ruth of her brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s coming later. He didn’t want to
tog up with us in the room. Guess he’s got a new
suit. But where’s Madge?”</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence among the
girls, and then Mabel said:</p>

<p>“She started out early, and wouldn’t say where
she was going. I thought she acted very strangely.”</p>

<p>“Say, she and Tom are up to some joke!” declared
Phil. “I thought there was something
queer about Tom.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll see ’em later,” suggested Sid.
“Come on, it’s too nice to stand still.”</p>

<p>They strolled on toward the clump of woods
where the lunch was to be eaten&mdash;happy lads and
gay lassies with Springtime in their hearts.</p>

<p>And, back in the room of the four chums, sat a
solitary figure&mdash;a figure on the old rickety sofa&mdash;a
figure that stared moodily down at the faded rug&mdash;a
figure that did not stir as the minutes were
ticked off on the fussy little alarm clock.</p>

<p>Out on the campus sounded the calls of a crowd
of lads at ball practice. Farther off could be
heard the cries of those who were leaping, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
or throwing weights in anticipation of the
track games. But the figure in the room gave no
heed to this.</p>

<p>Not moving, Tom continued to stare at nothing,
and the bitterness of his spirit grew on him.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand&mdash;I can’t understand,” he
murmured, over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>TOM SEES SOMETHING</small></h2>


<p>“What do you suppose keeps him?” asked
Sid.</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Phil, as he strolled beside
Helen Newton.</p>

<p>“Tom, of course. He ought to be here by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he missed a car,” suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>“He’s had time to get three or four,” declared
Frank. “I believe he’s playing some joke on
us.”</p>

<p>“Then Madge Tyler is also,” spoke Mabel
Harrison. “I wonder if she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There she is now!” suddenly exclaimed
Helen.</p>

<p>“And someone is with her. It isn’t&mdash;&mdash;” began
Ruth.</p>

<p>She stopped in sudden confusion, and all eyes
were turned toward a little open place in the
grove of trees, where two figures were seen&mdash;a
youth and a maiden. And, though the girl was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
undoubtedly Madge, the youth was not Tom Parsons,
and that fact held a world of meaning to all
of them.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Tom,” finished Phil, after a moment
of scrutiny. “Who is it! He’s got his back
turned this way.”</p>

<p>“Looks like Roger Barnes,” remarked Sid.</p>

<p>“No, I saw Roger with Clare Hopkins,” remarked
Mabel, naming two of the students at the
co-educational institution. “He tried to get up a
ball game for to-day, but none of the other boys
would agree to play. It isn’t Roger.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be Lem Sellig,” ventured Helen.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, let’s find a good place to eat
lunch,” proposed Ruth, with a laudable desire to
change the embarrassing subject. “Maybe Tom
will come along later. We must save him some.”</p>

<p>“Not too much,” objected Phil. “We’re hungry,
and he could just as well have been here on
time as not.”</p>

<p>“Phil, haven’t you any sense?” his sister managed
to whisper to him. “Can’t you see that
something has happened?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Phil, innocently enough. Phil
never was strong on intrigue.</p>

<p>“Oh! Stupid, I’ll tell you later!” whispered
Ruth. “Don’t say anything more now.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted Phil good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
“Every time I open my mouth I put my foot in it,
as the poet says.”</p>

<p>They all laughed&mdash;rather constrainedly it is
true, and more than one glance was directed
toward Madge Tyler and her companion ere they
disappeared amid the trees whence came the shouts
and laughter of the parties that had come on the
May walk.</p>

<p>“And that’s why Tom didn’t want to get
dressed, and come with us,” murmured Phil in
Sid’s ear when he got a chance. “He and Madge
had a quarrel.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. But who’s she with?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. Pass the pickles; will you?”</p>

<p>Thus Phil got rid of his friend’s worriment.</p>

<p>“Oh!” suddenly screamed Ruth, as she made
a quick movement away from where the table
cloth was spread out. “Oh, take it away, somebody!
Do!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Sid solicitously. “A
snake?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it’s something big and black.
I just saw it moving under the edge of that plate
of cocoanut macaroons. Oh!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it is,” spoke Sid, as he
reached his hand out toward the plate, “but be it
a veritable salamander I’ll take it away. Those
macaroons are too good to let a creeping or crawling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thing make off with them. Come out, you
villain!” he shouted, and lifted up the plate.</p>

<p>Something black, with whirring wings flew out
from its hiding place under the plate. It made
straight for Phil who, not exactly from fear, but
from instinct, dodged. It was a fatal error for
he lunged over toward the glass jar of lemonade
and, a moment later, the beverage had upset,
some of it flying over into the lap of Ruth.</p>

<p>“There, look what you’ve done!” she cried to
her brother. “And this was my best dress, too!
It’s ruined!”</p>

<p>She began wiping up the spots of lemonade
with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“It’ll come out,” consoled Phil, as he turned
to look at the flight of the fluttering insect.
“Take a little vinegar, or&mdash;er&mdash;something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Lemonade’s an acid, and it needs an alkali
to take it out,” declared Frank. “Vinegar is an
acid too. It isn’t a case of like curing like in this
case.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” demanded Sid. “Did
you ever take spots out of dresses?”</p>

<p>“No, but I did out of a pair of white trousers
that had the same sort of a bath as Ruth’s dress
got,” declared the Big Californian. “It worked
fine, too.”</p>

<p>“I think lemonade is neutral,” put in Phil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“At least this is, for there’s none left. Sorry I
spoiled the party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s more,” spoke Helen. “I brought
along a jar in my basket. Pass it over, will you
please, Phil.”</p>

<p>The additional supply of lemonade was
broached and they fell to talking merrily again,
though there was an undercurrent of suspense
noticeable. It was clear that the girls did not
know what to make of the absence of Madge,
and they tried to cover it up by gay laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t happen to bring along any
more sandwiches; did you Helen?” asked Phil
with a sigh, as he finished his&mdash;well, but what’s
the use in telling on a fellow, and keeping track of
the number of sandwiches he eats? Suppose
Phil did have a good appetite?</p>

<p>“Oh, Phil!” cried his sister. “You don’t
mean to say you’re going to eat more; are you?”</p>

<p>“I am if I can get ’em to eat,” was his cool
answer. “Some olives, too. You didn’t, by any
chance, I suppose, Helen, put another bottle in
that never-failing basket of yours; did you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did,” she answered with a laugh.
“I knew you boys would be hungry.”</p>

<p>“They’re never otherwise,” declared Ruth.</p>

<p>“Cruel sister, to treat her little brother so,”
commented Phil, as he used the corkscrew on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bottle of olives, while Helen got out more sandwiches.</p>

<p>There was a sudden pop, and the olive bottle
cork came out so unexpectedly that Phil, who was
kneeling down to perform that delicate operation,
went over backward, while Frank let out a cry
of dismay.</p>

<p>“My eye! Oh, my eye!” he exclaimed, holding
his hand to his face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?” demanded Sid
anxiously. “Did a piece of cork get in it?”</p>

<p>“No, but about a gallon of that olive juice
did!” retorted the afflicted one, as he used his
handkerchief vigorously. “You did that on purpose,
Phil.”</p>

<p>“I did not. The cork came out before I was
ready for it. I don’t see why they put ’em in so
tight.”</p>

<p>“All right, only don’t do it again,” begged
Frank. “Say, but it smarts! I wonder what
olive juice is made of, anyhow. I mean the stuff
they swim the green fruit in.”</p>

<p>“Nothing but salt and water,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. It’s sulphuric acid, to say the
least,” declared Frank. “It feels so in my eye,
anyhow. I wonder if they’re French or Italian
olives?”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Lots. I never can bear French olives, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wouldn’t have the juice of them in my eye for
anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh get out!” laughed Phil. “They’re Italian
all right. Pass the mustard for the sandwiches,
and let’s get this over with.”</p>

<p>“I thought you liked it,” spoke his sister.</p>

<p>“So I do, but if any more accidents happen I’ll
lose my appetite.” And so the merry lunch went
on.</p>

<p>The May walk was a great success&mdash;at least
so nearly every one voted. If there were some
who had little heart-burnings it was but natural
perhaps, and they would not last long. Miss
Philock was at her best, and allowed the girls
under her charge more than the usual liberties.
There was more or less formality connected with
the affair, and some note-taking in regard to the
flora encountered along the way was required.
But it was, in most cases, the very smallest minimum
that would serve to get the necessary class
marks.</p>

<p>The lunches had been eaten, and the boys and
girls strolled about the grove. Madge had not
been near her chums all day, and they felt it
keenly, though from a distance she had gaily
waved her hand to them. The boys had rather
lost interest in the identity of her companion.</p>

<p>“Oh, Phil,” called Helen to her escort as she
saw a pretty flower growing on a woodland bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“Get that for me, please. Look out for thorns,
though.”</p>

<p>“A-la-Miss Benson?” asked Phil, referring to
Tom’s escapade with the pretty girl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Helen with a laugh and a
blush. And then, as she looked at a stone at her
feet she screamed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Phil, scrambling down the
bank with such haste that he slipped, and rolled
nearly half the distance. “Did you sprain your
ankle?”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s a horrid snake!”</p>

<p>She pointed to a little one, not bigger than an
angle worm.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” sneered Phil. “It’s lost its mamma,
that’s all. You shouldn’t scare the poor thing so
by screaming.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! The horrid thing!” said Helen with a
shudder, as Phil tossed the snake gently into the
bushes. “I can’t bear anything that crawls.”</p>

<p>Then Phil, brushing the dirt from his new
trousers, made another and successful attempt to
get the flower. And so the day went on.</p>

<p>Back in his room Tom straightened up, and
looked from the window. The afternoon was
waning, and already long shadows athwart the
campus told of the setting sun.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said aloud. “I might as well go
out and walk about. They’ll be back pretty soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and then&mdash;&mdash;” he shrugged his shoulders.
“What’s the use?” he asked himself, apropos
of nothing in particular.</p>

<p>Some whim prompted him to board a car going
in the direction of Fairview. The May walk he
knew would be over by this time, save perhaps for
a few stragglers. And he hoped&mdash;yet what did
he hope?</p>

<p>Tom found himself walking through the little
grove where the boys and girls of the college had
eaten lunch a few hours before. The place
seemed deserted now, though now and then a distant
laugh told of some late-staying couple. The
sun was almost down, sending golden-red shafts
of light slanting through the newly-leafing trees.</p>

<p>Tom turned down a deserted path of beach
trees. He walked on, not heeding his course until,
as he neared a cross-trail, he heard voices. There
was the soft tones of a girl, and the deeper rumble
of a youth. Tom stepped back behind a sheltering
trunk, and only just in time, for the couple
suddenly stepped into view.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it been a perfect day?” asked the
youth.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;almost,” was his companion’s rather
indifferent answer.</p>

<p>“Why not altogether, Miss Tyler?”</p>

<p>Tom started at this. He peered from behind
the big beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing is perfect in this world,” was the
laughing answer.</p>

<p>The sun, suddenly dipping down, struck clearly
on the faces of the couple. Tom saw them, and
his lips formed a name.</p>

<p>“Shambler! That’s whom she meant when she
said she could not go with me. Shambler!”</p>

<p>The couple passed on, and Tom stood there
looking at them, his hands clenched so that the
nails deeply indented his palms.</p>

<p>“Shambler!” he murmured. “Shambler!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>SHAMBLER’S VISITOR</small></h2>


<p>Tom Parsons’s chums had the common sense&mdash;or
shall we say grace&mdash;not to mention his non-appearance
at the May walk. As they came into
the room at the close of the day that had meant
so much to them, and which had been fraught
with incidents that would be long remembered,
Sid, Phil and Frank acted just as though, all
along, they had not expected Tom to go, or as if
he would be on hand to meet them on their return.
For he was back ahead of them. He had
fairly rushed for a car after seeing Madge with
Shambler.</p>

<p>“Did you finish your book?” asked Frank, as
he slumped down into an easy chair.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Tom quietly. “I went for a
walk.”</p>

<p>“It was a fine day,” remarked Sid, taking the
companion chair to the one Frank had selected,
and with such violence did he fling himself into
it that the joints creaked and groaned in protest.
“I’m tired,” added Sid, in explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“No reason for killing the chair though,” objected
Phil. “That’s the old original, too, not
the one we got from Rosencranz. Treat it
gently.”</p>

<p>Tom was stretched out on the sofa, his arms
up over his head, staring at the ceiling. He moved
his feet to make room for Phil, who settled down
beside his chum.</p>

<p>For a space there was silence in the room, a
deep silence, for no one knew just what to say to
relieve the somewhat embarrassing situation. The
three did not just know what to make of Tom,
though they had heard, just before coming home,
that Madge Tyler was with Shambler, and that
explained much.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! The clock!” suddenly exclaimed
Sid, as the silence, which was beginning
to make itself felt, became so oppressive
that they were all aware that the clock had
stopped. “Have you been doing anything to it,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? No, it was going when I went
out. Maybe it needs winding.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” declared Sid with an air of relief
as, by testing the thumb screw that operated the
main spring, he found the time piece had indeed
run down. Soon its cheerful, if somewhat monotonous
ticking, filled the room.</p>

<p>“Well, now for some boning,” remarked Phil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with half a sigh, as he took off his stiff collar, and
made himself comfortable. “I understand the
Spring exams are going to be pretty stiff,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Well, they ought to be,” remarked Frank.
“We’re getting up in the world. We’re not in
the kindergarten class any more. But it will soon
be Summer, and then for a long rest. I’m going
out on a ranch, I think.”</p>

<p>“Me for the mountains,” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“And a lake and a motor-boat for me,” chimed
in Phil. “How about you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Haven’t made any plans. It
depends on how dad’s lawsuit comes out. I may
be a waiter in a hotel where some of you fellows
are sporting.”</p>

<p>“If you are, I’ll sit at your table and give you
big enough tips so you can come back to Randall
in the Fall,” spoke Sid with a laugh, in which the
others joined. And then, with minds that probably
dwelt more on the happenings of the day
than on their books, the three fell to studying.
But Tom remained stretched out on the sofa, with
his arms up over his head, and his eyes fixed on the
ceiling.</p>

<p>“Everybody out for practice to-day!” ordered
Holly Cross the following afternoon, as a crowd
of lads poured forth from Randall at the close of
the last lecture of the day. “Shot-putters, weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
throwers, runners, jumpers, hurdlers&mdash;everybody
on the job!”</p>

<p>“What’s the rush?” asked Phil. “Anything
new?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, in a way. The committee from the
four colleges met last night, and we’ve practically
decided to hold the meet. All the objectionable
points were done away with, and it only remains
to decide on the events and the date.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried the Big Californian.</p>

<p>“Wow! Something doing all right!” yelled
Shambler. “I’m going to get into my running
togs.”</p>

<p>“You’d think the whole college depended on
him,” remarked Sid, with a half sneer, as the new
student hastened toward the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re counting on him to win the mile
run for us,” said Holly. “He’s the best we’ve
struck yet, even if he is loaded to the muzzle with
conceit. Come on, now, you fellows, get busy.”</p>

<p>“Did those new hurdles come?” asked Frank
Simpson, who was much interested in the proposed
one hundred and twenty yard hurdle race.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll have them out on the path pretty
soon,” replied Holly. “They’re fine, and it only
takes a few seconds to change from one height
to another. See how you like ’em.”</p>

<p><a href="#image03">Soon the athletic field at Randall presented a
busy scene.</a> Lads in all sorts of undress uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from running trunks to jerseys and sweaters, were
at practice.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, in the seven-foot circle, Phil was balancing
himself for the hammer throw, while off to one
side Tom was adjusting the toe board in order
to put the sixteen pound shot. Frank Simpson was
assisting one of the janitors in setting up the new
hurdles, and Sid was testing his vaulting pole.</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager, whose big frame and
mighty muscles gave him an advantage few others
enjoyed, was juggling with the fifty-six pound
weight.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do better than twenty-five feet
to-day,” he declared, and forthwith he swung up
the big iron ball with its triangular handle and
heaved it.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five feet eight inches!” announced a
measurer.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll beat that yet,” predicted Dutch with
a laugh.</p>

<p>Shambler came running from the gymnasium
attired in his new suit. He presented an attractive
figure; Tom could not help admitting that,
much as he disliked the newcomer. And certainly
Shambler could run. He had a certain confident
air, and a manner about him that counted for
much.</p>

<p>The practice went on, and Holly Cross and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Kindlings, who had been voted into permanent
trainers and managers interchangeably, watched
with keen eyes the performances of all the lads.</p>

<p>“There’s some good stuff here,” remarked
Holly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Kindlings, “if they’ll only practice
and keep at it. It’s quite a while to the games
though, and any one of them may go stale. This
isn’t like baseball or football. If we don’t win
one game on the diamond or gridiron, we have
another chance. But we won’t in the all-around
contests. It’s do or die the first time.”</p>

<p>“Why, you aren’t worried, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, but Boxer Hall would give her head to
beat us, and we can’t take any chances. Say, just
hold the watch on Shambler, will you? I think
he’s hitting it up to-day.”</p>

<p>Holly walked over to the cinder track, where
Shambler was about to finish his mile run. As he
breasted the tape Holly pressed his stop watch.</p>

<p>“Time!” panted Shambler.</p>

<p>“Six minutes, fifty-six seconds,” reported
Holly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to get it down to six and a
half before I’m done,” went on the new student.
“I can do it.”</p>

<p>“Better take it easy,” advised the trainer. As
he spoke he saw a change come over Shambler’s
face, and there was a light in his eyes that told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
someone approaching to speak to him. Holly
wheeled about to confront a rather shabbily
dressed man&mdash;a stranger, walking toward Shambler.</p>

<p>“Hello, Shambler,” greeted the newcomer.
“At your old game, I see. I thought I’d find
you.”</p>

<p>The change that came over Shambler was surprising.
Even as he turned away, to look after
some of the other contestants, Holly was aware
of it. It seemed, he said afterward, as though
Shambler was afraid, or ashamed of being spoken
to by the shabby visitor.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad to see me?” went on the man.
“I came a long way to see you, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course,” broke in the runner. “Come
on over here where we can talk. I didn’t expect
you.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell when I’m going to show
up,” was the answer, and Holly, hurrying away,
thought that the words contained a half threat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>TOM IS SUSPICIOUS</small></h2>


<p>Tom Parsons, who was one of the best all-around
athletes at Randall, believed in doing a
variety of things in order to keep himself in form.
He realized that if he devoted himself exclusively
to one thing he might excel in that, to the detriment
of some other form of sport. He was one
of the best pitchers Randall had ever sent into the
box, and it had been said of him that had he devoted
more time to running, pole vaulting, broad
or high jumping, he could have made fine records
at either. But he preferred to be a little better
than the average at either one, and yet he did
not want to strain himself to be a top-notcher.</p>

<p>“I’m just sort of going to hold myself in reserve,”
he said to Holly, “and you can fill me in
wherever you need me.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” the young manager had
agreed, and so to-day Tom was practicing with
the sixteen pound shot. In order to be out of the
way of the others, and so that he might not be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
closely watched, Tom had set the toe board some
distance off. There he was heaving the shot to
his heart’s content.</p>

<p>He was not far from a corner of the gymnasium,
which building was now pretty well emptied,
since nearly every lad who intended to try
for a place in the games was out on the field.</p>

<p>As Tom went to recover the shot, after a
“put” that gave him considerable satisfaction
from the distance covered, he saw two figures
passing behind the angle of the building. One he
knew at once for that of Shambler. The other&mdash;that
of a shabbily dressed man&mdash;was not familiar
to him.</p>

<p>Since the little episode of the May walk, Tom
had had no occasion to speak to Shambler, and
the latter, whether or not he was aware of anything
unusual, did not show any curiosity over
Tom’s behavior.</p>

<p>As Tom heaved the shot again, the toe of his
tennis shoe caught on the board, and part of the
sole was ripped off.</p>

<p>“Serves me right for using that old pair,”
mused the lad. “I’ve got another pair in my
locker, I’ll put them on.”</p>

<p>He was rummaging among his things in the
gymnasium, when he became aware of voices outside,
directly under an open ventilating window.
And it did not take very sharp ears to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
one of the voices was Shambler’s. Without in
the least meaning to be an eavesdropper, Tom
could not help hearing something of what was
said.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem at all glad to see me,” spoke
the voice of the shabby man.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not. I wish you hadn’t come
here. Why didn’t you send me word, and I
could have met you in the village? It doesn’t
look good, you coming here on the college
grounds.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m not dressed well enough,” was
the sneering retort.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about that. Only some of
the fellows may be suspicious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll never guess. You’ve changed
your name; haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Not so loud! Of course I have,
but I can’t change my face, and I’m afraid every
day of getting found out. But what do you want,
Nelson?”</p>

<p>“What do I always want, but money? Did you
think I came here to pass the time of day?”</p>

<p>“I wish you had.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded the man,
sharply.</p>

<p>“I mean that I haven’t any money for you.”</p>

<p>“Why, look here&mdash;er&mdash;Shambler&mdash;you’ve just
got to have money for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got to is a strong word, Nelson.”</p>

<p>“I know it, and I mean it. I’m broke I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Then get it from someone else. I haven’t
any.”</p>

<p>“Why, what have you been doing here all this
while, I’d like to know?” and the man’s voice
took on a whine.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been picking up gold dollars, if
that’s what you mean, Nelson. I’ve been bucking
down and studying hard. It is isn’t as easy at
Randall as it was at Harkness.”</p>

<p>“What’d you come here for then?”</p>

<p>“Because athletics are better managed. Now
look here. You know the games won’t take place
for some time yet, and I can’t get any cash until
they’re run off. I have just enough to get along
on as it is, but if things go right I’ll have plenty
later on.”</p>

<p>“Backing yourself, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Hush! You can’t tell who may hear you.
I tell you it was a big risk for you to come here
to-day. I wish you hadn’t. You had better go
away now. Go out this way, where no one will
notice you.”</p>

<p>“I will when I get some money&mdash;not before,”
growled the man.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it, Nelson! Do you want to spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
everything? I tell you I can’t give you any money.
Why don’t you go see some of the others?”</p>

<p>“They’re broke too. I was counting on you,
and I’ve just got to have it. Come now, fork
over. You can cut out some of your fancy business,
and make it up.”</p>

<p>“Fancy business? I’m living plainer than any
one else in college. I haven’t given a spread,
and I don’t go to ’em when I can help it, for I
can’t return the compliment.”</p>

<p>“So that’s why he hasn’t been around much,”
mused Tom. “He hasn’t the money. Well,
that’s nothing against him, but I must say I’m
suspicious of this talk. I&mdash;I wish I hadn’t heard
it.”</p>

<p>Tom had on his other shoes now, and was preparing
to leave the gymnasium. Then the voices
resumed.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll spare you a little,” said Shambler,
“though it’s a hard pull. Now don’t you come
back here until after the games. If all goes right
you’ll get your share.”</p>

<p>“I should think I would, after what I’ve done
for you,” retorted the other. “Come on now,
fork over. I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get it. It’s in my clothes in the
gym. Wait here for me.”</p>

<p>Tom changed his mind about going out just
then, as he felt that he might meet Shambler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
He slipped into one of the shower bath compartments
and waited there until he heard the runner
enter and leave again. Then came the jingle of
coins through the open window, and the sound
of retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>“That sure was queer,” mused Tom, as he
slipped from the gymnasium, and went back at his
shot putting. “I wonder what sort of a hold
that fellow had on Shambler, to get money out of
him? It looks bad, and yet I can’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to listen, but, since I did, I can’t
tell anyone that I did. But it sure is queer. I
wonder how he expects to make any money off
the games, unless he bets on Randall? Of course,
that’s legitimate enough, if one believes in betting.”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. It was too much for
him. And, as he thought of how Shambler had,
of late, crossed his path in more ways than one,
the tall pitcher was more and more puzzled over
the growing mystery.</p>

<p>“I wish I could tell the fellows, and talk it
over with them,” he went on, as he made an
extraordinary good put. “But it’s out of the
question. I’ll have to puzzle it out by myself.
But I’ll keep my eyes open for that shabby looking
man.”</p>

<p>The fellow was not in sight when Tom came
out of the gymnasium, and Shambler had resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his training, while Tom went back to the
seven foot circle.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ve had enough for to-day,”
called Holly Cross to the various contestants, a
little later. “No use overdoing the thing, and
going stale. Knock off, everybody!”</p>

<p>“And glad enough we are to do it, too!”
gasped Dutch, who was in a perspiration from his
efforts. Everyone was in a healthy glow, and as
Holly and Kindlings looked at the notes of some
of the records made that day there was a look of
satisfaction between them.</p>

<p>“If this keeps up we’ll be all right,” remarked
Holly.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Everything seems to be going
well, but, of course, we want all the points we
can get. I think the new hurdles are an improvement.
There’s no danger of a fellow getting
hurt, and it gives him more confidence as he approaches
them. We must insist on them in the
games.”</p>

<p>“Think the others will agree to ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. We’ve given in to them on lots of
points, and it’s no more than fair that they should
concede something to us.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll all decide on Tonoka
Park as the place to hold the games?”</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure of it. It’s big enough, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
will hold a good crowd. That’s what we want
so we can get plenty of admission money. Boxer
and Fairview are in favor of Tonoka, and so
are we. Exter will have to agree with three
against her.”</p>

<p>“They had rather stiff nerve to want the contests
to come off on their grounds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t anticipate trouble there.”</p>

<p>And the two managers walked on, talking over
many points yet to be settled.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, how goes it?” asked Sid as the
four chums entered the gymnasium for showers.</p>

<p>“Pretty good. I didn’t strain myself to-day,
but I’m coming on.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Say, I hear that Shambler is
doing well on the mile run.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Tom shortly. “He’s a good
runner.”</p>

<p>“Tom’s still sore,” murmured Sid to Frank.</p>

<p>“Can’t blame him. You’d be too.”</p>

<p>Then conversation was interrupted by the
splashing of water, to be succeeded by various
grunts and puffings, as the boys vigorously rubbed
down after their practice.</p>

<p>“Telegram for you, Mr. Parsons,” announced
one of the messengers about the college, as he
met our hero coming from the gymnasium. “I’ve
been up to your room, but you weren’t there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Tom, as he ripped off
the end of the yellow envelope. His companions
watched his face curiously as he read the message.</p>

<p>“Hum, I’ve got to go home,” announced Tom,
a moment later.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>FRANK’S SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>“Home!” exclaimed Sid.</p>

<p>“Going to leave?” inquired Phil.</p>

<p>“For good?” demanded the Big Californian.
“Say now, that’s tough! I was hoping this thing
would at least hold off until after the games, Tom.
What’s the row?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that lawsuit business, I suppose. Dad
doesn’t give any particulars. He just says: ‘Come
home at once.’”</p>

<p>There was a silence among the inseparables
for a moment or two, and then Sid said:</p>

<p>“Say, let’s go to our room and talk this over.
Maybe it isn’t so bad as it seems.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Phil, as they
walked on.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe Tom is only called home temporarily.
His dad may want some help, or
something like that, and he can come back in a
short time. Let’s think that, anyhow, and don’t
go to getting up a farewell banquet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, come now!” objected Tom. “None of
that farewell-feed business, even if I do have to
go.”</p>

<p>“You dry up!” commanded Frank. “I guess
we’ll give you a banquet if we want to, if you’re
going to leave. But you’re not. I believe, as Sid
does, that it’s only temporary. You’ll start right
away, of course?”</p>

<p>“As soon as Moses lets me. I can catch the
midnight train, and be at home in the morning.
I guess it must be that dad needs my testimony,
or an affidavit or something in connection with
the lawsuit. It will be tried over again soon, and I
helped dad on some of his books and papers,
when he went into that horse deal. I’ll go see
Moses now, and get a permit.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to break training,” remarked
Phil a bit regretfully, as Tom walked toward the
residence of Dr. Churchill. “You’ll have to work
doubly hard when you come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess Randall won’t lose much by my
absence for a few days,” answered Tom with a
laugh. “There are enough fellows to hold her
end up.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Holly Cross, coming
along at that moment. “No treason, Parsons.
Randall wants every loyal son to stand up for her
honor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” replied the pitcher. “I’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
on the job later,” and he explained about the telegram.</p>

<p>Holly was sorry, and expressed the hope that
Tom would quickly be back. Soon, having secured
the necessary permission from the venerable
president, Tom was in his room with his chums.</p>

<p>“We’ll help you pack,” volunteered Phil.
“You won’t need much but a pair of pajamas
and a toothbrush.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” agreed Tom. “If I
have to stay home for good I can send for the
rest of my things.”</p>

<p>“Perish the thought!” exclaimed Sid, and, for
the first time since the receipt of the telegram,
there came over the spirit of gaiety that had existed,
a cloud of apprehension and sorrow. For,
though they all hoped that Tom would not have to
leave Randall, there was the ever-present possibility
that events would so shape themselves.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll let us know, as soon as you hear,
what the worst news is; won’t you?” asked Frank,
as he fairly threw himself on the old couch.
“We want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the rest of Frank’s sentence was lost in a
momentous cracking sound, a splintering of wood
and a tearing of cloth. Then a cloud of dust
filled the room, and following the crash, there
came a melancholy voice, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh sweet spirits of nitre! Now I have gone
and done it! She’s busted!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Sid.</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“The old couch. I&mdash;I sat down too hard on it.
The back is broken, I guess. Lend me a hand,
somebody!”</p>

<p>Frank tried to struggle to his feet, but he had
been pinned fast between the collapsed parts of
the couch, and had to be fairly pulled out.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you had done it,” remarked
Sid mournfully, as he surveyed the wreck of the
old sofa.</p>

<p>“Can’t it be mended?” asked Tom, trying to
raise the two ends. The couch was like a ship
with a broken back.</p>

<p>“Sure it can be fixed,” put in Frank, rubbing
his hips where he had been pinched. “It’s only
those extra boards that were nailed on last term.
We can put fresh ones on&mdash;stronger ones, or, if
we can’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frank hesitated, and a cunning look came over
his face.</p>

<p>“Well, what?” asked Tom suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” answered Frank vaguely. “I&mdash;er&mdash;I
guess it can be fixed all right.” He bent
over the sofa, and began propping up the ends on
piles of books. “It’ll do to sit on, if you do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
carefully, until I can nail it up in the morning,”
he added.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t <em>you</em> sit on it,” warned Phil significantly.</p>

<p>“And for cats’ sake, don’t let him wind the
clock, or he’ll bust the spring of that,” added
Tom.</p>

<p>“Keep out of that chair!” cried Sid, as Frank
was about to sink into one of the big pieces of
furniture. “You’re a regular vandal. Everything
you touch you bust.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t sit there, either,” put in Phil, as
Frank turned toward the other chair.</p>

<p>“Where will I sit then?”</p>

<p>“On the floor. That’s solid enough,” spoke
Tom.</p>

<p>By turns they examined the couch, the three
shaking their heads mournfully at the author of
the mischief, until, when the joke had been carried
far enough, they turned their attention to
Tom, and assisted him in his rather limited preparations
for the trip. They escorted him to the
station shortly before train time, their prayer for
a special dispensation in regard to being out late,
having been granted.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to wire as soon as you have any
news,” begged Sid as they left their chum, and
Tom promised. He kept his word, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was a message for the three before noon the next
day.</p>

<p>The general surmise was correct. Tom’s presence
was only needed in order to sign some affidavits
in relation to the lawsuit, and he stated
that he would be back at Randall the next day.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to get up a sort of celebration!”
cried Frank, dancing about with the telegram
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!” agreed Sid. “We’ll
have a spread in our room, Zane or no Zane.”</p>

<p>“And to-night let’s take in a theatre,” suggested
Frank. “I’m in funds. Just got my allowance.
I’ll blow you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Wow! You are a sport!” declared Phil,
clapping the Big Californian on the back.</p>

<p>They took a chance on “running the guard,”
in going to the theatre that evening, and, later
Phil and Sid both agreed that Frank had acted
rather strangely. After buying the theatre tickets
the big lad offered to treat his chums to sodas,
and, while these were being consumed, he made
an excuse to slip out of the drug store.</p>

<p>“I just want to go next door to telephone,” he
said. “I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>“There’s a telephone here,” suggested the
drug clerk, as Frank started out.</p>

<p>“I never can hear good over that ’phone,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Californian said. “I’ll go in the furniture shop
next door. I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>“What’s he got up his sleeve now, I wonder?”
spoke Phil.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” was his chum’s reply. “Maybe
something about Tom’s spread.”</p>

<p>The boys enjoyed the play, and were fortunate
enough to get back to college unobserved. Frank
offered no explanation of his telephone message,
and Sid and Phil did not think to ask questions.</p>

<p>The next day, when Phil and Sid were practicing
on the field, a messenger came to summon
Frank. The big lad hurried off, unheeding the
calls of his chums.</p>

<p>“What in the world is up?” asked Phil wonderingly.</p>

<p>Sid could not guess, but when Frank returned,
about an hour later, they both “put it to him
straight.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no mystery about it,” said Frank
calmly. “I just went in to fix the old sofa. I got
a new kind of brace for the back and seat and I
wanted to glue ’em on in daylight. Don’t any
of you fellows sit on it, if you get to the room before
I do, or you’ll bust it worse than ever.”</p>

<p>They promised, but Frank took good care that
they did not precede him to the room. As the
three entered together, having surreptitiously arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for the spread, Phil and Sid saw the sofa
was covered with a winding sheet.</p>

<p>“For cats’ sake!” cried Sid. “What’s that
for?”</p>

<p>“Is anybody dead?” demanded Phil.</p>

<p>“No, it’s&mdash;er&mdash;the sofa,” explained Frank.
“I just put that on so nobody would sit on it by
mistake until it was dry. Come on, now, Tom
will be here pretty soon. Let’s get ready for
him. Have we got enough to eat?”</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” replied Sid, looking at the
numerous packages, and then rather suspiciously
at the sofa.</p>

<p>Tom was due to arrive about eight o’clock, and
a little crowd of his friends was at the station to
meet the train.</p>

<p>“Everything all right?” greeted Frank, as the
tall pitcher stepped to the platform.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re all ready for the lawsuit now,
though I can’t say how it’s coming out. How
are things here?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” replied Holly Cross. “We’re going
to blow you&mdash;it’s Frank’s surprise.” And forthwith
they escorted the returned one to college.</p>

<p>It required no little ingenuity on the part of the
lads to get to the room of the inseparables unchallenged,
but it was finally accomplished.</p>

<p>“For the love of mustard, what’s that?” demanded
Tom, as he saw the sheeted sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Frank’s work of reparation,” answered
Phil. “He’s fixed the sofa. Isn’t it dry
yet, you old Mugwump?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it is,” answered Frank. Then,
taking his position near the article of furniture,
he began cutting the string that held the sheet in
place. He had tied it securely, a measure of precaution
that alone had prevented Phil and Sid
from lifting the veil to see what sort of a repair
job the Big Californian had done.</p>

<p>“Boys,” went on Frank, as at last he was ready
to pull off the sheet, “I have a little surprise for
you.”</p>

<p>“Surprise!” repeated Tom blankly.</p>

<p>“Spring it!” ordered Dutch Housenlager.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE AUCTION</small></h2>


<p>There was an eager pressing forward on the
part of all in the room. Frank stood facing his
chums and companions, a curious look on his face.</p>

<p>“So this is what he’s been up to all this while,”
murmured Phil.</p>

<p>“He gave us the double cross,” commented
Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, go ahead, unveil the statue,” suggested
Holly. “This suspense is terrible!”</p>

<p>With a sudden pull Frank whisked the sheet
to one side, and there followed a gasp of astonishment.
For a moment no one spoke. Surprise
held them dumb. Then Tom found his voice.</p>

<p>“Oh mudlarks!” he cried feebly.</p>

<p>“Paregoric!” came faintly from Sid.</p>

<p>“Catch me, somebody, before I faint!”
gasped Phil, as he staggered back into the arms
of Dutch Housenlager, who promptly deposited
him on the floor.</p>

<p>And well might the three chums give vent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ejaculations of surprise, dismay and anguish.</p>

<p>For there, in place of the old sofa that had
served them in calm and storm, in stress of disaster
and in the joys of victories, there stood a
new and shining piece of furniture&mdash;spick and
span in bright green plush, with a glossy mahogany
frame&mdash;a davenport, large, roomy, comfortable&mdash;the
acme of luxury. The old sofa had been
metamorphosed&mdash;it had suffered a “sea change
into something new and strange,” as Holly quoted
afterward.</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;what has happened?” asked Phil
weakly, rubbing his eyes to make sure it was not
a vision of the night.</p>

<p>“Can I believe my senses?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“He told us he had a surprise,” murmured
Tom slowly, “and it sure is.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like it, fellows?” asked
Frank, after a momentous pause. “I thought,
as long as I had broken the other sofa, that it
was up to me to get a new one. We’ve been needing
one a long time, and when I found that the
other couldn’t be fixed very well, I just had the
furniture man bring in this new one. It’s my
treat. That’s what I telephoned about the night
we went to the show. How do you like it?”</p>

<p>For a moment no one answered. Then Tom
went slowly over to the new davenport, and softly
felt of the springy seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s real,” he murmured, in disappointed
tones.</p>

<p>Phil wet one finger, cautiously applied it to the
green plush, and then pretended to taste of his
digit, as though he was a doctor, sampling some
new and rare kind of drug.</p>

<p>“Yes, it&mdash;it’s real,” he emitted with a sigh.</p>

<p>Sid carefully rubbed his handkerchief on the
shining mahogany frame.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m afraid so,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“Why, you mutts! of course it’s real,” gasped
Frank. “It’s a new one in place of the old sofa.
That isn’t any good any more. This is a dandy.
Four of us can sit on it at once, the man said, and
it won’t sag or break. Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what did you do with our old one?”
asked Tom solemnly. “Be careful now. Think
well before you answer, and remember that whatever
admissions you make may be used in court
against you.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;” stammered Frank.</p>

<p>“Answer the question!” demanded Sid sternly.</p>

<p>“Where’s our old sofa?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“The janitor took it away, when you were
out,” replied the conspirator. “Why&mdash;why,
don’t you like this one?”</p>

<p>The three shook their heads. Then Tom said
softly:</p>

<p>“Can’t you see, Frank? It doesn’t fit in. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
doesn’t go with the rest of the things in the room?
It’s too new&mdash;too shiny. It’s like a modern among
the ancients. They clash!”</p>

<p>“Horribly!” shuddered Sid.</p>

<p>“It won’t do&mdash;it won’t do at all,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“I leave it to Holly&mdash;to Dutch&mdash;anybody,”
burst out Frank. “It’s the best I could buy.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, old chap,” admitted Tom.
“That’s just the trouble. It’s too good&mdash;too
nice&mdash;too new. It makes our rug, and the old
armchairs&mdash;to say nothing of the clock&mdash;look like
a second-hand store in the presence of a Louis the
Fourteenth drawing room. It won’t do, old
man.”</p>

<p>For a moment Frank stared at the new piece
of furniture. Then he sat down on it, sinking
low in its luxurious depths.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty comfortable,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Where did you say the old one was?” asked
Tom softly.</p>

<p>“I had the janitor carry it down to the cellar.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” began Phil gently, “I wonder if
we could get it up again to-night, without making
too much of a row? Somehow, I don’t like
the idea of eating a spread in here with that new
davenport staring us in the face. It’s like a
stranger that hasn’t been properly introduced.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess we can get the old one back,”
agreed Frank, and, somehow his voice did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
show much disappointment that his surprise had
proved a boomerang. “I fixed it up, after a
fashion, or, rather, I had the janitor do it. I
was thinking we might give it to him.”</p>

<p>“Give away our old sofa!” cried Phil, Tom
and Sid in a chorus. “Never!”</p>

<p>“This one surely doesn’t fit in this room&mdash;not
with your other antiques,” ventured Holly Cross.</p>

<p>Frank got up, walked across the apartment,
and took a survey of his surprise. Then he slowly
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I guess you’re right,” he admitted.
“It clashes&mdash;doesn’t fill in right.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t mind if we get the old one
back?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Frank softly. “I’ll go tell the
janitor now. I&mdash;I guess this can stay here for&mdash;er&mdash;well
a day or two; can’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Tom.</p>

<p>With a more cheerful air than his friends supposed
he could assume under the circumstances,
Frank threw the sheet back over the new sofa.
Then he went to summon the janitor.</p>

<p>Presently, while the crowd in the room was beginning
to open the packages of smuggled food,
a noise was heard out in the corridor. Tom threw
open the door.</p>

<p>“Welcome home, wanderer!” he greeted, as
the old sofa was brought in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear old friend,” murmured Phil, while Sid
gently pushed with his hand on the seat to ascertain
if it would hold his weight.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Frank requested of the janitor. “I’ll
help you carry this new one out. There isn’t
room for the two in here.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but sure it’s a shame to put that one
down cellar,” objected the janitor. “It’ll get all
mildew.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be there long,” remarked Frank
significantly, and when he came back, after having
helped dispose of the new davenport, he carried
a hammer and some tacks. He went to a
desk and scribbled something on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Then he went out in the hall, and, presently his
friends heard a gentle tapping on the door.</p>

<p>“What’s Frank up to now?” asked Tom.
“Another surprise?”</p>

<p>Sid swung wide the portal, and disclosed the Big
Californian in the act of affixing a notice to the
panels.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Read,” invited Frank.</p>

<p>And they read this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">AUCTION SALE</p>

<p>The undersigned will dispose of, at auction in
the gymnasium to-morrow afternoon, one brand
new davenport, upholstered in green plush. Same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
has never been used, but the present owners desire
to dispose of it. It will be sold, without reservation,
to the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="right">FRANK SIMPSON.</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” gasped Tom, as he
read the notice.</p>

<p>Then they overwhelmed Frank with questions
as they began to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>TOM’S TEMPTATION</small></h2>


<p>“Are you really going to sell it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Is this a fake?”</p>

<p>“What’s the upset price?”</p>

<p>“Honor bright, now! It isn’t a joke; is it?”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the questions that
were put to the Big Californian, as a crowd of
boys filed into the gymnasium the next day after
the auction notice had been posted.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s straight all right,” answered Frank.
“The davenport, which is as new as heart could
wish, will be sold to the highest bidder. We&mdash;er&mdash;that
is I&mdash;bought it by mistake. We didn’t
need it. Our old sofa has been fixed up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say Frank,” expostulated Tom,
when he got a chance to speak to his chum privately.
“You could send this back to the store,
and get nearly all you paid for it. You won’t
get half what it’s worth, at auction.”</p>

<p>“I don’t give a hang. I’m going to sell it this
way. It will be fun. Besides, whatever is realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
is going into the athletic fund, anyhow.
That’ll make bidding higher.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it will. But say, you must have struck
it rich to blow in all that cash.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so much. I got the davenport at a
bargain, anyhow, and I thought it would be just
the thing for our room. But I can see, now, that
it isn’t. Say, there’s a good crowd coming, all
right.”</p>

<p>“There sure is. Have you got it here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw Prexy, and explained how it was.
He said I could auction it off. Proc. Zane put up
a stiff kick, though, but Moses overruled him, and
it’s going on. I guess the janitor has the old
shebang on hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there it is,” answered Tom, as he and
his friend entered the gymnasium, and caught
sight of the new davenport, supported on two
leathered-covered “horses.”</p>

<p>The crowd, laughing, talking, chaffing each
other and the inseparables, filed into the big
room, until it scarce could hold any more. Frank
took his place in front of the piece of furniture,
and soon the bidding was under way.</p>

<p>It began low, but was spirited enough. Sid,
Tom and Phil refrained from raising the bids,
but there was no lack of others. By small advances
the price crept up to seven dollars. There
it hung for a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seven-fifty!” sung out Shambler.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five!” came from Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>“Eighty,” put in another voice, and Phil whispered
to Tom:</p>

<p>“The Jersey twins are bidding against each
other, and they don’t know it. This is rich!
Frank will get more than he paid if this keeps
on!”</p>

<p>The bidding became more spirited, being confined
chiefly to Shambler, and the two twins, the
latter, being in separate parts of the big auditorium,
not knowing that they were whip-sawing
one another.</p>

<p>Finally, when the price reached fourteen dollars
and thirty-five cents, the davenport was knocked
down to Shambler, who ordered the piece of furniture
taken to his room.</p>

<p>“It will do to stretch out on when I come in
from a run,” he remarked to some of his intimate
friends. And, though Tom had no special
interest in what became of Frank’s “surprise,” as
it had been dubbed, still the pitcher felt himself
wishing that someone else besides Shambler had
secured it.</p>

<p>The new student seemed to feel that the purchasing
of the davenport from one of the inseparables
entitled him to a closer acquaintanceship
with them. For, a few days after the auction, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
called at their room, and made himself rather at
home.</p>

<p>“Cosy place you’ve got here,” he remarked,
blowing cigarette smoke about in clouds. “Quite
a collection of antiques.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we like old things best,” remarked Tom
significantly, wondering whether the lines about
“old books, and old friends,” would recur to
Shambler. But it did not seem to.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t be long before we have the
Spring games,” went on the visitor. “I’ll be
glad of it, too, for I’m training hard, too hard,
I guess. I’m going to have a little recreation to-night.
Some friends and I are going in to town.
Don’t some of you want to come along?”</p>

<p>None of the inseparables accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>“I’m taking chances, too,” went on Shambler.
“I’ve been caught two or three times, lately, and
Zane warned me that the next time would mean
suspension. But I’ll chance it. A fellow has to
have some fun. Any of you smoke?” and he
extended his box of cigarettes.</p>

<p>“It’s bad&mdash;when you’re in training,” remarked
Phil. “Count us out.”</p>

<p>“You, too, Parsons?” asked Shambler. “Say,
by the way,” he went on, “I met a friend of
yours the other night. Miss Tyler, of Fairview.
At least she said she knew you. Fine girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” half growled Tom, the blood flushing
his face. “I’m going to see if there’s any mail,”
he added quickly, as he left the room.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” asked Shambler of the
others. “Have I been poaching on his preserves?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask him,” replied Phil, with
significant glances at his chums.</p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed the visitor. “I have
a notion he has a hasty temper. But aren’t any
of you coming to town for a lark?”</p>

<p>No one was, evidently, and Shambler soon took
his leave. It was some time before Tom returned,
and he had no letters. His chums did not bring
up the subject of his going out.</p>

<p>Tom, in preparation for the examinations, had
permission that night to spend some time in the
rooms of a senior who had volunteered to coach
him on some points wherein our hero was a bit
behind in his class. The senior’s room was in
another dormitory from where Tom and his
chums roomed, being across the campus.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when the tall pitcher was
on his way back to his own particular part of the
college, and, as he was about to open the dormitory
main door, with a pass key with which he had
been provided, a dark figure hurried up the steps
from the shadow of a statue on the campus, and
stood at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say!” came in a cautious whisper. “Let
me in with you, will you? I overstayed in town,
and I don’t want to be caught.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Tom, wondering for a moment
who was speaking, and then he recognized
Shambler’s voice.</p>

<p>“It’s Parsons!” whispered the new student,
evidently much relieved. “I’m in luck! I’ve been
waiting here half an hour hoping Zane’s light
would go out, and that I could bribe one of the
janitors, or a monitor, to let me in. But the old
Proc. is staying up infernally late. But it’s all
right now. You have a key; haven’t you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tom shortly, as he inserted
it in the lock.</p>

<p>“Talk about luck!” exulted Shambler, as he
slipped in ahead of Tom, who stood back to let
him pass in first. “It’s great, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. A wave of revulsion
against this lad seemed to sweep over him, and he
recalled a certain day in the woods when he had
seen the fellow with Madge Tyler.</p>

<p>Shambler, not seeming to notice the grouchiness
of his companion, passed hurriedly along the dark
corridor toward his room. Tom walked more
slowly, having made sure that the door was
locked after him. He had not gone half a dozen
steps, before the door of the proctor’s office
opened, and Mr. Zane stepped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Parsons,” replied our hero. “I had permission.
I was studying with Morrison.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I recollect. Who came in with you,
Parsons?”</p>

<p>“In with me?” repeated Tom, for he had
hoped that this question would not be asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard the footsteps of two, and you
were the only one in this dormitory who had permission
to be out to-night. Who came in with
you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;I don’t wish to tell, Mr.
Zane.”</p>

<p>“I demand to know,” said the proctor sternly.
“You let someone in; did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you won’t tell who it was?”</p>

<p>Tom hesitated for a moment, but it was only a
moment. There came an instant of temptation.
He recalled what Shambler had said about the
probability of suspension if he was caught again.</p>

<p>“And it would be a good thing if he did go,”
thought Tom bitterly. “Good for Randall&mdash;good.
But then the games! We need him!”</p>

<p>Then he knew that it was a selfish motive that
was urging him to take advantage of the chance
thrown in his way.</p>

<p>“No! No! I&mdash;I can’t do it!” he cried within
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” asked the proctor sharply.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t tell you,” answered Tom simply.</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t?”</p>

<p>“If you prefer to put it that way&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I will see you in the morning,”
and, turning on his heel, the proctor went back
into his office.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE TRY-OUTS</small></h2>


<p>There must have been rather a strenuous time
between Dr. Churchill and Proctor Zane early
the next morning&mdash;a discussion concerning college
ethics that, as Tom learned later, had a bearing
on his own case. But nothing came of it, and
though at chapel Dr. Churchill spoke rather solemnly
on “duty” he made no direct reference to
anyone.</p>

<p>Tom was not summoned to the proctor’s office,
for which he was duly thankful, not that he felt
that he would have betrayed Shambler, but he
did not like to be cross-questioned.</p>

<p>Just how the news leaked out no one could say,
but such things do become known, more or less, in
all colleges, and it was common rumor that the
proctor and the president had differed materially
on the point of making Tom tell. But Dr.
Churchill won his contention, and the episode
became a closed one.</p>

<p>As the days of Spring wore on, with the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
growing greener, and the weather more and more
mild, there came over all a spirit of unrest, and
yet not so much unrest as it was a desire to be
up and doing.</p>

<p>The diamond was being put in shape. The
line-up of the nine was already much talked of,
but, overshadowing all this, was the prospect of
the track games. Several meetings had been held
of the committees in charge of the proposed big
meet, and final details were being gradually
worked out.</p>

<p>It had been practically decided that the affair
would be held in Tonoka Park. This was a sort
of summer resort near Tonoka Lake, which gave
the name to the football and baseball leagues, of
which I have written elsewhere.</p>

<p>Exter, the new member of the league, showed
a disposition to have the meet held on their own
athletic grounds, which a millionaire had presented
to the institution, with much display of
black type in the newspapers. But the contentions
of Randall, Boxer Hall and Fairview were heeded.
They were to the effect that a neutral field was
fairer for all concerned.</p>

<p>But there was much else to be done. While,
naturally, I have dwelt mostly on the doings at
Randall in this volume, of course much the same
things were being done at the other three institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>There was practice, practice and still more
practice, on all sides. Trainers and coachers were
busy at each college, and the gymnasiums and
fields presented animated scenes every day.
Everyone was training hard, for this was the first
holding of the quadruple meet, and each college
wanted to win.</p>

<p>It had been decided that the total number of
points scored should decide the winner. And, to
this end, the rules of the Amateur Athletic Union
had been adopted.</p>

<p>“How many events are going to be run off?”
asked Tom one afternoon, as Holly Cross and
Kindlings were holding a consultation. “When
are we going to know ’em?”</p>

<p>“We can tell you now what events will likely
be the main ones,” answered Holly. “Of course,
more may be added after we have the final try-outs
and pick those who are to hold up the honor
of Randall.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a mile run, a hurdle race, high
jumping, broad jumping, putting the fifty-six
pound weight, the sixteen pound shot, and the
hammer-throw. Then there’ll be a pole-vaulting
contest, and probably a hundred-yard dash. Oh,
there’s to be honor and glory enough for all who
make good.”</p>

<p>“And the try-outs?” asked Sid. “I’d like to
know if I’ve got to train to the minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“We all have!” exclaimed Holly. “Not a
man at Randall can afford to grow stale. Hello,
there comes Shambler. I’m hoping a lot from
him. If he pulls down the mile run for us it will
help a lot. Then we’re depending on Dutch in
the weight contest, and&mdash;well, but what’s the use
of talking&mdash;we’re counting on every man in Randall.
We want to win all the events if we can.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll be there with the goods!” declared
Frank Simpson.</p>

<p>“Well, everybody on his mark!” went on
Holly. “I think the final try-outs will be held in
a few days, and then we’ll know who we’ll have to
depend on specially. Of course there may be
changes later on, but we want to get a line on
where we stand.”</p>

<p>For the next few days practice went on unceasingly.
From early morning until dusk fell
some of the boys were out on the field, running,
leaping, springing, using the pole, testing themselves
in the broad or high jump, taking hurdles
or throwing weights or hammers. And the four
inseparables did their share.</p>

<p>Shambler, too, was active. He was rapidly
forging to the front as one of the best athletes
that had ever worn the “R” of Randall, and
though many did not care much for him, even his
enemies had to admit that he was likely to bring
honor to the college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was mighty white of you, old man, not
to give me away,” he said to Tom, one day, after
the rumor of the demand made by the proctor had
become quite well known. “I’ll not forget it,
either, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;don’t get caught&mdash;that’s all,” was
Tom’s not very gracious reply.</p>

<p>“No more chances for me,” declared Shambler.
“Too much depends on it.”</p>

<p>Tom wondered whether he meant his own
fortunes, or those of Randall, and he could not
help thinking of the shabby man who had been so
eager to get money from the new student.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on! Everybody on the
job!” cried Holly Cross one fine afternoon.
“This is the last chance! Final try-outs this
afternoon!”</p>

<p>The crowd of athletes poured from the gymnasium,
where the notice had been posted for
some time, and flocked out on the field, ready to
do their best to win the coveted places of defending
the honor of Randall.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the mile run first,” decided Kindlings,
after a talk with Holly. “We’ll pick the
three best men to go in the games against Boxer
Hall, Fairview and Exter. Come on now, you
fellows who are going to run.”</p>

<p>An eager crowd watched the preparations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
warm-up practice. Then came the crack of the
pistol, and the field was off.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to describe the preliminary
trials in detail, so I will merely state
that Shambler came out first in the mile run, with
Tom Parsons second and Jerry Jackson third.</p>

<p>“They’ll go in for Randall,” announced Holly,
as he jotted down the names. “Now for the
broad jump.”</p>

<p>In this Frank Simpson came out ahead, with Sid
Henderson second and Pete Backus third.</p>

<p>“But I’m going to win when it comes to the
final,” declared Pete earnestly. “I haven’t had
enough practice yet.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll never get it, I’m afraid,” said
Kindlings under his breath. Still he could not
help but admire the persistency of “the grasshopper.”</p>

<p>There was much interest in the one hundred
and twenty yard hurdle race, and this promised
to be one of the best events on the card.</p>

<p>The new pieces of apparatus were used, and
worked well. Phil Clinton came out ahead, but
Joe Jackson was a close second. When it came
to picking third there was hard work, for Sam
Looper, Dan Woodhouse, Kindlings and Sid
Henderson were so well bunched that it was hard
to decide, and the six were put down as possible
starters against the rival colleges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>In the high jump Berry Foster was first, with
Jim Weston second and Paul Hughes third.
Dutch Housenlager, with his big bunches of muscles
easily won the palm at throwing the fifty-six
pound weight, Dan Woodhouse being second and
Bean Perkins, who said it would not interfere
with his shouting abilities, coming out third.</p>

<p>Phil Clinton easily distanced the others at the
pole vaulting contest, Red Warren being second
and Holly Cross third; while at putting the sixteen
pound shot, Dan Woodhouse won, with
Frank Simpson second and Sid as a good third.</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve got this much settled we can
come somewhere knowing where we’re at,” declared
Holly, after the final try-outs. “This
doesn’t mean that none of you fellows haven’t a
chance,” he hastened to add, “for we may need
any one of you yet, so keep in training.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad this much is over,” remarked
Tom, as he joined his three chums, who were
walking toward the gymnasium for a welcome
shower bath.</p>

<p>“Same here!” cried a voice behind them, and
Shambler came running up. “Say,” he cried, “I
wish the games were to-morrow, instead of a
week or more off. I’m as fit as a fiddle!”</p>

<p>In what was probably the exuberance of his
animal spirits he came running up, and, with a
leap landed on Frank’s back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look out!” cried the Big Californian.
“You’ll upset me!”</p>

<p>“It’ll do you good!” cried Shambler. “Here
we go!”</p>

<p>But Frank, who was rather tired, was in no
mood for horse-play of this character. He
slewed around, slumped over and fairly dumped
Shambler off his shoulders.</p>

<p>A moment later the new student came down
heavily on Frank’s foot with his spiked running
shoes. There was a cry of pain from Frank, a
well-meant gasp of apology from the offender,
and then the lad from the state of the Golden
Gate limped painfully to one side.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“My foot! My foot!” murmured Frank.
“I’m afraid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He would have fallen had not Phil caught him,
while the others gathered about Shambler with
a look of concern on his face.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>“WE NEED EVERY POINT”</small></h2>


<p>“Say, old man, I’m mighty sorry about that!”
cried the lad who had caused the mischief, as he
put his arm about Frank. “I wouldn’t have done
it for the world&mdash;I slipped. Are you badly
hurt?”</p>

<p>It needed but a glance at Frank’s shoe, whence
came a few drops of blood, to show that he was
painfully hurt, if not seriously crippled.</p>

<p>“The spikes have gone clear through!” gasped
Sid.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not as bad as that,” said Frank.
“Get my shoe off, fellows, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A spasm of pain prevented him from finishing
the sentence and he sat down on the ground. Tom
had the shoe off quickly.</p>

<p>It was seen that two of the spikes on Shambler’s
sole had gone through the outer, fleshy
part of Frank’s foot. There was a little bleeding,
but it soon stopped.</p>

<p>“That’s got to be looked at at once!” decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Holly Cross when he saw it. “You’re likely to
go lame, old man.”</p>

<p>“Jove! That’s bad,” murmured Phil, and
several black looks were cast at Shambler, for all
the lads knew how much depended on Frank in
the broad jumping contest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I’ll be all right,” spoke the injured
lad, whose pain was abated somewhat with
the removal of the shoe, for his foot had begun
to swell. “It’s all right, Shambler. I know you
didn’t mean to do it. I’ll be in shape for the meet
all right.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, old man,” spoke the new lad sincerely,
and his former joyous spirits seemed to
have slipped from him like a garment. Tom felt
himself disliking Shambler with a feeling that was
akin to hate, and he had to fight hard to keep control
of his temper. As it was he murmured under
his breath:</p>

<p>“The cad! I wish he’d never come to Randall!”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys, we’ll have to give Frank a
hand up,” suggested Holly. “Help him to his
room, and we’ll get the Doc to look at him.”</p>

<p>Willing hands assisted Frank along, so that he
did not have to bear any weight on his injured
foot. Shambler wanted to help, but Tom, Sid
and Phil insisted on giving “first aid,” and they
were sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The physician looked grave when he saw the
injury, not so much at the nature of the hurt itself,
for it was comparatively slight, but he was
concerned for what might develop.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you’re going to do any jumping
for the next month,” said the physician, when
told that Frank was expected to hold up Randall’s
end of the big events.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’ve got to!” declared the Big Californian.
“To paraphrase the old saying, ‘Randall
expects every lad to do his duty.’ I’ve got to
jump.”</p>

<p>“Then I have to tell you that if you do, you
may lame yourself for the rest of your life,”
went on the doctor seriously. “Some of the tendons
are cut, and unless they heal properly you
are liable to tear them loose if you put too much
strain on them. You’ve got to be careful.”</p>

<p>Frank groaned, and his chums looked anxious.
Holly Cross and Kindlings, who were at the conference,
shook their heads.</p>

<p>“We’ll just have to make other arrangements
then,” said Holly, as he walked out with his companion
manager. “If Frank can’t jump he may
be able to help out in the hammer, or weight-throwing
contests.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try that, as soon as he’s able to be up,”
decided Kindlings. “This is bad business. I’ll
give Shambler a call down. He’s too fresh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t say anything,” said Holly.
“He feels badly enough as it is, and we don’t
want any more disruption among the fellows than
possible. We aren’t going to have any walkover
in these games.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right. Well, we’ll do our best,
but I wish this hadn’t happened.”</p>

<p>Frank’s foot was very painful the next day,
and much swollen, but the doctor said there was
no special cause for alarm, as it had been treated
with antiseptics.</p>

<p>But the Big Californian had to keep in bed, and
this was irksome to him, as he was naturally active.
Phil, Tom and Sid did all they could to
make his imprisonment cheerful, and Shambler
called several times, to express over and over
again his regret at his carelessness. The others
took rather a liking to him, but Tom could not
bring himself to be friendly. He was sure Shambler
had some secret that he was afraid would be
discovered.</p>

<p>Tom had not seen Madge Tyler since the
memorable day of the May walk, but from his
chums, who paid several visits to the co-educational
institution, the pitcher learned that Madge
had not been out with Shambler since.</p>

<p>“I believe she did it just to spite me, because
of that little incident with Miss Benson,” reasoned
Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>A week after the accident Frank was able to
step on his foot, but the doctor strictly forbade
any violent exercise. However he did not prohibit
practice at weight throwing, and Frank soon
proved himself an expert at this, almost equaling
Dutch, so that Holly and Kindlings made a temporary
shift in their list of entrants.</p>

<p>“But I’ll be in the jump all right,” asserted
Frank, and rather to the surprise of the doctor
the injured foot healed so well and rapidly that
there was a prospect, after all, that the Big Californian
could take the place originally assigned
to him.</p>

<p>“I hope he can,” said Holly. “For we need
him, and Sid Henderson, while he’s good, isn’t
quite up to Frank’s mark.”</p>

<p>Sid knew this himself, but he was, by constant
work, gradually improving. Meanwhile hard
practice went on among the various track squads.</p>

<p>The grounds at Tonoka Park were being put
in shape for the big quadruple meet, and there was
every prospect of success. The various committees
held frequent meetings, and it was said that
many tickets were being disposed of, so that there
was a prospect of well-filled treasuries.</p>

<p>Many of the lads against whom Tom and his
chums had played football or baseball were to
uphold the colors of Boxer Hall and Fairview.
As regarded Exter little was known, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was rumored that a number of well-known amateurs
were enrolled under her banner.</p>

<p>“Exter is the only one we haven’t a good line
on,” said Holly Cross one afternoon, as he called
at the room of the inseparables to inquire about
Frank, who was almost himself again.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t have any fear about her fellows;
do you?” asked Tom, taking the call as an
excuse to stop studying.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, in a way. I tell you, boys, Randall
will need every point she can pile up. You
know how we score, with a thousand points as the
maximum for the best in each class of events.
Seconds and fractions of inches count, so don’t
forget that, and go for every last ounce of
strength or wind that you have. A point in any
event may make or break us.”</p>

<p>“Will it be as close as that?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Indeed it will. Every man of Randall will
have to be strictly on the job, as I’ve said before.
This isn’t a football match, where, if you don’t
make a touchdown one quarter, you may the next.”
Holly spoke seriously.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ll be there with the goods,” declared
Phil.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” spoke the young trainer,
as he took his leave, warning Frank to take care
of himself, and get in the best possible condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you really think you’ll jump?” asked
Holly.</p>

<p>“Sure I will. I saw the doctor, and while he
said I must be careful, still, he didn’t absolutely
forbid me as he did at first. I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we know that,” declared Tom clapping
his big chum on the shoulder.</p>

<p>There followed a period of silence in the room,
after Holly had left. The four tried to study,
but their thoughts were plainly more on the coming
games than on their books. Finally Tom,
tossing aside his Latin book, gave a big yawn
and said:</p>

<p>“I’m going for a row. It’s too nice to stay in,
and there isn’t any practice ordered for this afternoon.
Who’s coming out on the river with me?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” spoke Sid. “I can’t spare the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh come on, you old misanthrope,” urged
the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Nope. Take Frank, he needs the air.”</p>

<p>“Then you come too, Phil.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m back in my work, and I’ve just got
to make it up, or I’ll be conditioned, and you
know what that means. You and Frank are the
brainy pair; you go.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” asked Tom; and Frank consented.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>ON THE RIVER</small></h2>


<p>The afternoon was warm&mdash;almost too warm
for that time of year, and Tom and Frank, as
they neared the river, felt the breeze sweeping
up from the water.</p>

<p>“That’s something like,” remarked Frank, who
now walked with scarcely the semblance of a limp.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’ll do us good to get cooled off,” said
Tom. “I hope there’s a decent boat left.”</p>

<p>There were several rowing craft, owned by the
college, which were used in common by the students,
it being a case of first come first served. In
addition a number of the lads had boats of their
own, but Tom was not one of the lucky ones.</p>

<p>“There’s Holly’s skiff,” remarked the Big Californian,
as the two came near the boat house.
“He won’t use it to-day, as he’s gone to a meeting
of the athletic committee over at Exter. Let’s
pinch that.”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess he won’t mind. It’s the
only decent one left, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why Randall never did much shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
racing?” mused Frank, as he and his chum were
floating idly down the river. “I should think
the fellows would. There’s a good course here,
and with Boxer Hall, and Fairview, so close by,
and near the river, there ought to be more interest
in the sport.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, there had,” agreed Tom, casting
a glance over his shoulder to see if the course
was clear. “Maybe we will have a good crew,
after we see how these games come out. What
we need is some one to stir things up. Randall,
from what I hear, didn’t use to take any interest in
sports. It’s only of late years that she’s come
to the front. Of course there has been some rowing
here, and one or two good races, but nothing
to boast of. What do you say if we start something?”</p>

<p>“I’m willing. We four might get a shell and
challenge Boxer Hall. I like rowing, and it’s
good exercise. But it’s too late to do anything
this term, especially with the games coming on.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, but it’s worth thinking of,”
agreed Frank. “We’ll keep it in mind. Want
me to row?”</p>

<p>“No, you sit still and take it easy. You’re out
for your health you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you be hanged!” was the half-protesting
answer. “You’d have ’em think I was an invalid.
I’m all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope you keep so,” was Tom’s comment, as
he bent to the oars.</p>

<p>They went down the river for a mile or so,
talking of many things, but chiefly of the coming
contests. Then, as they neared the vicinity of a
little recreation park, which was not far from
Fairview Institute, Frank exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Aren’t those some of our friends on shore?”</p>

<p>Tom looked across, being close to the bank at
the time, and saw two young ladies.</p>

<p>“It looks like&mdash;&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“It’s Miss Tyler, and Miss Harrison,” broke
in Frank quickly. “I say, Tom, put me ashore,
will you, I want to speak to them for a minute.
Come on up, and have a chat.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Tom shortly. “You can go,
though,” and he swung the boat in toward land.
A moment later Frank had leaped ashore and was
walking toward the young ladies, who seemed surprised
to see him. They turned to look at Tom,
who raised his hat.</p>

<p>Our hero was not a little astonished when, a
moment later, Frank and Miss Harrison strolled
off down a woodland path, leaving Madge Tyler
alone there.</p>

<p>“He’s got nerve!” mused Tom, and his cheeks
began to burn. Miss Tyler started to walk away
from the river, and at the sight of her Tom took
a sudden resolve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hang it all!” he murmured, “I’m going to
chance it. She can’t any more than turn me
down.”</p>

<p>A moment later he, too, had leaped ashore,
tying the boat to an overhanging tree, and then he
started to overtake the girl who occupied so much
of his thoughts.</p>

<p>“I say&mdash;Miss Tyler&mdash;Madge!” he called.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” she replied, coldly, as
though just aware of his presence.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t do very well,” blurted out Tom.
“I&mdash;er&mdash;say, what’s the matter, Madge?” he
asked helplessly and utterly unable to dissemble
any longer.</p>

<p>“The matter? Why, I didn’t know that anything
was.”</p>

<p>“Yes you did. That May walk&mdash;why wouldn’t
you let me go with you?”</p>

<p>“Why, I fancied you had a previous engagement,”
and her eyes, in which she could not altogether
conceal the lurking glance of mischief,
looked straight at Tom, making his heart beat
faster than usual.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean that Miss Benson? That was
an accident. She had scratched herself and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were a very efficient first-aider,” came
the quick retort.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say now, Madge&mdash;that isn’t fair. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
couldn’t help it&mdash;honestly. Say, come for a row;
will you? It’s early yet.”</p>

<p>“And leave Mabel?”</p>

<p>“She left you, or, rather, Frank kidnapped her.
We’ll get them, if you like, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know as it’s necessary,” was Miss
Tyler’s calm but quick response, and the mischief
in her eyes grew. “If you’re sure you want me,
I’ll come, but I’m not going to get scratched with
a thorn, so you can save your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say now, that’s not fair,” laughed Tom.
“I haven’t seen Miss Benson since, though I suppose
you and Mr. Shambler&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tom!” she exclaimed, half angrily, and our
hero had the sense to say no more. The two
were soon in the boat, Tom rowing idly along under
the arches of overhanging bushes.</p>

<p>The little misunderstanding had passed away,
and the two were their happy selves again. Tom’s
first care was to make sure that he would see Miss
Tyler at the games, and she promised to be on
hand, and to join a little party that Tom and his
chums were planning after the events had been
run off.</p>

<p>“But I think you had better put me ashore
now,” said Madge after a bit. “It is getting
late, and it’s quite a walk for Mabel and me back
to Fairview. There she is now, waving to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom saw Frank and Miss Harrison on shore
beckoning to them.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say, we haven’t been out long at
all,” he protested. “Can’t you stay a little
longer?”</p>

<p>Madge shook her head, smiling the while, and,
rather against his will, Tom put about, and began
to row back to where Frank and his friend waited.
As he swung out into the stream he heard voices
on shore, and they at once struck him as being
familiar. A moment later he had a glimpse of
Shambler, talking to a man&mdash;the same untidy individual
who had been with the student near the
gymnasium some time previous. Miss Tyler saw
Shambler, at the same moment.</p>

<p>“Look, Tom!” she exclaimed softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see him,” was the pitcher’s answer.
“I don’t care, now, though. I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Is that a Randall man with him?” Madge
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head, and, the next moment
there came floating clearly across the water this
scrap of conversation:</p>

<p>“I tell you I’ve got to have more money!”
said the shabbily-dressed man.</p>

<p>“And I tell you I won’t have any until after
the games&mdash;a week from now,” replied Shambler.
Then it seemed as if the man made an effort to
strike him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!” cried Miss Tyler, involuntarily.</p>

<p>Like a flash Shambler turned at the sound of
the voice. He and the man had been standing
on the bank, behind a clump of bushes, but a sudden
movement brought them into plain view. The
new student saw the occupants of the boat. For
an instant he stared at them, and then, as though
caught in some questionable act, he made a dive
into the woods, and was lost to sight. The man
stood there for a moment, as if bewildered, and
then, he, too, vanished.</p>

<p>“That was rather queer,” remarked Miss
Tyler.</p>

<p>“Very,” assented Tom.</p>

<p>“I wonder if&mdash;if they came here to&mdash;to fight?”
she faltered.</p>

<p>“Not very likely,” replied Tom dryly. “They
are friends I guess, though I don’t know who the
man is.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer way for a friend to act,” commented
Madge. “Mr. Shambler is&mdash;queer, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Had much opportunity to judge?” asked Tom
mischievously.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. I have only met him a few
times, and I only went with him that once to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get even with me,” finished Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Mean! Smarty!” pouted Madge.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, I deserved it, I guess,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
admitted Tom, for he did not want to run any
further chances. “But Shambler <em>is</em> queer, though
he’s one of the best athletes we’ve got. He beat
me in the mile run try-out. He’s our star
sprinter.”</p>

<p>“You’ll need plenty. Our boys are going to
win at the meet,” predicted Madge.</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Tom, with mock heroics in
his voice. “Like the old guard, Randall may die
but never surrender.”</p>

<p>With a little bump the boat hit the sandy bank,
and Tom helped Madge out. Frank and Mabel
came to meet them, and, after a little chat, the
two girls said good-bye, for they had to return to
Fairview.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a wonder you wouldn’t thank me,”
said Frank to his chum, when they were rowing
back toward Randall.</p>

<p>“Thank you&mdash;what for?”</p>

<p>“For giving you the chance you needed. I
took Mabel and myself off so you could straighten
things out. Did you?”</p>

<p>“I did!” exclaimed Tom with a laugh. “It’s
all right now. We’re friends again. Much
obliged!”</p>

<p>“Good. I thought though, from the serious
looks you both wore as the boat came to shore,
that it was all off.”</p>

<p>“No, that was on account of something we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
saw. Shambler was back there a way, talking
with a questionable looking chap.”</p>

<p>“Ha! The same one who called for him one
day?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t like the looks of it. It seems
as if something was up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re too much given to imagining
things, Tom,” declared Frank. “Shambler’s all
right, I think.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I hope so, and yet&mdash;&mdash;” Tom
shook his head without finishing the sentence, and
the remainder of the row was finished in comparative
silence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>CURIOSITY</small></h2>


<p>Tom said nothing to either of his other chums
about seeing Shambler in that rather lonely spot
along the river. Nor did he tell Frank all the
details of the little scene.</p>

<p>“If it’s all right, there’s no use making a fuss
over it,” reasoned the pitcher, “and if there’s
something wrong it isn’t up to me to bring it out.
I’ll keep still about it.”</p>

<p>There were busy times at Randall now, for with
the near approach of the day of the games, practice
went on almost without let-up. Frank was in
such shape that he declared he would jump, and
he had also done so well in the weight throwing
trials that it was decided to have him as one of
the contestants for that event.</p>

<p>“Everybody do his best now!” urged Holly
Cross, as he hustled the lads out on the field for
practice one day. “Beat your own records, and
then do even better next week.”</p>

<p>It was the final practice before the posting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the names of those who would take part, and
though it was expected that there might be some
changes, there were none of any moment. The
same ones whom I have already mentioned were
finally decided on to uphold the honor of Randall,
though a few new lads were entered as emergency
material, several of them developing into available
contestants almost at the last minute.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a slight change in the
program,” remarked Kindlings to the crowd of
boys when practice was about over. “We’re
going to have a big hurdle race the day before
the other games, and one or two events for the
younger lads.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, after going over it all, the committees
decided that there wouldn’t be time to run off
all the events in one day, and so we decided to
have a preliminary meet one afternoon a few days
before the main one. Everyone seemed to like
the idea, which was brought up by Exter, so we
fell in with it. The hurdle race is always popular,
and if we split up things, we’ll get two crowds
instead of one, and make that much more money.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” declared Frank. “Me for the
hurdle.”</p>

<p>“Better save yourself for the main show,”
warned Holly.</p>

<p>A meeting of the committees of arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
from the four colleges was scheduled for the next
afternoon, and, as Tom, and some of the other
lads had time to spare they went with Holly,
Kindlings, and the others of the committee to
attend. The session was to be held at Exter.</p>

<p>“There’s Shambler,” remarked Phil, as with
his chums and the others, they stood waiting for
the trolley. “I wonder if he’s coming?”</p>

<p>“It’s a free country,” declared Frank. “We
can’t stop him.”</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows,” greeted the new student, as
he sauntered up. “Guess I’ll take in the show if
you haven’t any objections.”</p>

<p>“No, come along,” invited Holly, for he realized
that considerable depended on Shambler in
the coming games.</p>

<p>“How’s the foot, Simpson?” went on the lad
who had caused the mischief to Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, practically. But that doesn’t
mean that I want you to jump on my back again,”
exclaimed the Big Californian, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No danger,” promised Shambler. “I thought
I’d like to size up some of these Exter lads, and
see what sort of material we’ve got to go up
against,” he explained to Kindlings, who nodded
comprehendingly.</p>

<p>There were a number of lads from Boxer Hall,
and several from Fairview on hand at Exter when
the committee went into session. The meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
was held behind closed doors, and meanwhile
those who had come as spectators strolled about
over the Exter grounds.</p>

<p>“Some college all right,” admired Shambler,
who was making himself very much at home all
over the place.</p>

<p>“But it can’t come up to Randall, even if it is
newer,” declared Phil. “You can’t make a college
in a year or so.”</p>

<p>The Exter lads were sociably inclined, and
made their guests informally welcome. There
was talk among the representatives of the four
institutions about the coming games.</p>

<p>“Is that lad one of your contestants?” asked
an Exter youth of Tom, who at the time was
standing off by himself.</p>

<p>“Which one?” inquired the tall pitcher.</p>

<p>“Shambler, I think he calls himself,” and the
new student was pointed out.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s Shambler,” replied Tom.
“He’s going in the mile run for us. We’re counting
a lot on him. But why do you say he ‘calls’
himself Shambler?” and Tom’s old suspicions at
once recurred to him. “Isn’t that his name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as far as I know. I wasn’t just certain
of it, that’s all. So he’s going to run for you?
Do you know much about him&mdash;where he came
from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Harkness, I believe. Why, do you know
him?”</p>

<p>Tom was somewhat impressed by the curiosity
of the Exter student.</p>

<p>“I think I have seen him before,” was the slow
and rather puzzling reply. “But maybe I’m mistaken.
You’re going to take part; aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a sort of filler-in,” laughed Tom.
“Baseball is my strong point.”</p>

<p>“Same here. I’m glad to have met you. Maybe
we’ll have some fun on the diamond after these
games.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” and Tom turned aside, with the intention
of joining his chums. As he did so he saw
the Exter lad, who had introduced himself as Hal
Durkin, link arms with another youth from his
own college. Tom could not help overhearing
what they said.</p>

<p>“Did you learn anything?” asked the lad who
had joined Durkin, and who, Tom learned later,
was Jack Pendleton.</p>

<p>“Not much. He goes by the name Shambler
now, but I’m almost sure he’s the same fellow.”</p>

<p>“You are? Then this thing has got to be
looked into. We’re not going up against any such
game as that. It wouldn’t be fair.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” agreed Durkin. “But we
must go slow. It wouldn’t do to make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I should say not. There’d be a pretty muddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
if we did. But I’m sure I’m right, though I’m
going to get more information before I say anything.
Come on over, and we’ll talk to some of
the fellows about it.”</p>

<p>“Now I wonder what in the world is up?”
mused Tom. “They were certainly talking about
Shambler, and from what they said it seems as if
that wasn’t his name. I wonder if there can be
anything wrong? Jove! I hope not, for the sake
of Randall. And yet what could it be? Maybe
he isn’t the best kind of a character, but that can’t
make any difference in his standing as an athlete.
If these Exter fellows are as squeamish as that,
it’s time we knew it.”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously Tom found himself defending
the lad for whom he had felt such a dislike,
not long since. Perhaps the little talk with
Madge Tyler had made a change in our hero.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t say anything about it,” decided
the tall pitcher. “But I’ll keep my eyes and ears
open.”</p>

<p>The session of the joint committee was almost
over when Sid, who had been strolling about, met
Tom.</p>

<p>“I say,” began Sid, “I just had a sort of funny
experience.”</p>

<p>“What kind?” asked Tom, wondering if Sid’s
was anything like his own.</p>

<p>“Why some of these Exter fellows have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
asking me questions about one of our lads, such
as where he came from, what sort of a record he
had, and all that.”</p>

<p>“They have?” cried Tom. “Was it about
Shambler? Because if it was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t Shambler,” replied Sid. “Why,
have you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” blurted out Tom.</p>

<p>“Frank Simpson,” was the unexpected reply.
“Our own Frank.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Tom, as if unwilling to believe
it. “They wanted to know about Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all about how long he’d been at Randall,
where he came from, what his record was, and
whether he was going to take part in the games.”</p>

<p>“What’d you tell ’em?”</p>

<p>“I said I didn’t know much about him, except
that he came from Stanford University, where he
was a crackerjack on the gridiron. I said he was
going to pull down some points for us on the track,
too.”</p>

<p>“What did they say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that they thanked me, and I
heard one of ’em say to the other that they were
going to ‘look it up,’ whatever that meant.”</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Tom, “there’s something in the
wind, Sid. I had almost the same experience, only
it was about Shambler. I wonder what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, of course. I guess these Exter lads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
are so high-toned that they want to know a fellow’s
pedigree before they’ll compete with him. Maybe
he has to have ancestors that came over in the
Mayflower, or else are D. A. R. or F. F. V.
members.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” cried Tom in protest. “What
would the Daughters of the American Revolution,
or the First Families of Virginia have to do with
whether or not Exter lads would compete with
us?”</p>

<p>“Well, I only mentioned it,” said Sid. “There’s
something up, that’s sure. But it can’t be much.
Frank is as straight as a string, and, while I think
Shambler is a bit of a sport, no one can say anything
about his abilities as an athlete. He’s one
of the best in Randall.”</p>

<p>“I grant you that,” declared Tom, “but it’s
mighty queer. We’ll keep still about it, and see
what turns up.”</p>

<p>“Why, I had it in mind to tip Frank and Shambler
off, that someone was making inquiries about
them,” spoke Sid.</p>

<p>“Forget it,” advised his chum. “It will only
raise a row. Just wait and see how it comes out.
Then will be time enough to spring it, though for
the life of me I can’t see what those Exter lads
are going to ‘investigate,’ Sid.”</p>

<p>“Same here. Maybe they need a little investigating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on their own account, though they seem
like a nice class of fellows.”</p>

<p>Tom and Sid talked the matter over at some
length, but could come to no conclusion. They
decided not to mention to Phil what they had
heard, though it was the first time they had kept
a secret from their new chums.</p>

<p>To Tom and Sid, it seemed that there were
many suspicious looks cast at Frank and Shambler
on the part of more than one Exter lad, and yet,
they agreed later, this might be only the effect of
their imagination. The two lads, whose names
had thus been so oddly brought up, were not,
seemingly, aware of anything unusual.</p>

<p>The conference broke up, and Holly and Kindlings
joined their friends from Randall.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all settled,” announced Holly.
“We’ll post the names day after to-morrow, of all
those who will contest in the first event. Then
after two days, to give a chance for protests, we’ll
run off the big hurdle race. Later on all the
names will be posted.”</p>

<p>“What’s that about a chance for protests?”
asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>“That’s the usual thing,” explained Kindlings.
“The names have to be posted, and if any fellow
wants to protest against another he has that right,
and the committee will hear charges.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think there’ll be any protests?” asked
Sid, looking at Tom significantly.</p>

<p>“No. Why should there be?” inquired Holly
quickly. “But the rules call for the posting of
the names in that way, just the same. You don’t
object; do you?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. Say, that hurdle race ought
to be sport,” and Sid thus changed the subject
quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, Randall has a good chance for first
prize,” declared Kindlings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE BIG HURDLE RACE</small></h2>


<p>“Come on now, fellows, all together!” cried
Bean Perkins, the most redoubtable cheer-leader
and shouter that Randall ever numbered among
her sons. “All together, and we’ll give ’em a
song to warm ’em up!”</p>

<p>“What’ll it be?” demanded a lad in the throng
that was to urge on the sons of Randall in cheer
and chorus. “‘Conquer or die,’ Bean?”</p>

<p>“Naw! Save that song until you see we need
it. Give ’em something jolly.”</p>

<p>“How about ‘We’re Going to Wipe the Ground
Up, With Boxer Hall To-Day?’” asked another.</p>

<p>“Nothing to it,” replied Bean. “We’ll sing
‘I’d rather be a Randallite, and live on sawdust
pie, than go to any other place beneath the bright
blue sky!’ That’s the kind of a song they need.
All together now.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!”</p>

<p>“Sing hearty, everybody!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let her go, Bean!”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the cries that greeted
the sturdy little cheer leader who stood before
his crowd of lads at Tonoka Park field that day
of the great hurdle race. For it had come at last,
the day of days&mdash;the day that was to usher in the
preliminary event in which Randall hoped to triumph.</p>

<p>As had been previously decided the hurdle race,
because of the number of entrants, would be run
off several days before the other contests. Each
college had a number of men who wished to try
their skill in this, as it was generally thought that
the element of luck would enter largely, and it
would be necessary to run a number of heats.</p>

<p>Tom, Sid, and Phil, among others were on
hand, the three having all been picked to go in
the race. Frank decided not to compete. All of
Randall’s contestants were in readiness, and they
had scarcely arrived at the field ere they were
joined by the throngs from the other institutions.
Bean Perkins got his cheersters and songsters at
work early, and soon the strains of the different
choruses welled over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>There was not as large a throng present as
would attend at the main meet, but the managers
were satisfied. In addition to the hurdle race a
number of events for the younger lads in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
preparatory departments of each college were to
be run off.</p>

<p>Boxer Hall, Fairview and Exter had their cheer
leaders at work, and a riot of “melody,” if such
it can be called, welled forth. It was a beautifully
sunshiny day, just warm enough, and the
track, with the new hurdles supplied by Randall,
was in perfect shape.</p>

<p>“There are the girls!” exclaimed Phil, as he
and his chums started toward the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>This announcement, that never is without its
heart-interest, no matter where made, had the
usual effect. Tom and Sid at once demanded:</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Right in front of you,” replied Phil. “Can’t
you see ’em waving?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and say ‘how-d’ye-do,’ and then
get into our togs,” proposed Tom. “I don’t want
to go over in that crowd after I get into my
Roman toga.”</p>

<p>“Bashful!” taunted Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m not so stuck on myself as you are,” retorted
Tom, and then he dodged to escape a playful
blow.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use asking us to cheer for you,”
said Ruth, as her brother and his chums drew
near. “We’re loyal to Fairview,” and she waved
a flag of her college colors in his face.</p>

<p>“Wait until you’re asked, Sis,” retorted Phil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
“We don’t need your cheers. Listen to Bean
and his bunch.”</p>

<p>“Once more!” cried the shouter to his crowd.
“This time we’ll give ’em ‘Over the hurdles and
far away,’ composed especially for this occasion.”</p>

<p>The singing began.</p>

<p>“Mercy! What howling!” cried Madge, in
pretended horror.</p>

<p>“It’ll sound sweeter when they sing Randall’s
praises,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“Now, just for that I won’t speak to you to-morrow,”
she said, with a pretended pout.</p>

<p>There was laughter and jollity among the
youths and maidens. Tom and his chums greeted
old friends and athletic foes from Fairview and
Boxer Hall, until Holly Cross, coming along,
sarcastically suggested that if there was going to
be a hurdle race that day it was time to dress for
it.</p>

<p>There were to be four heats, and Tom and
Phil found themselves drawn in the first one. Of
course in the finals the best men from each college
would participate.</p>

<p>The hurdles had been set up, and carefully
looked to. Last measurements were taken, and
the rules announced once more. It was to be a
quarter mile race final, instead of the usual one
hundred and twenty yards, for the reason that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
there were no other big events that day; but the
preliminary heats were the regulation distance.</p>

<p>“Get ready!” called the starter, as he raised
his pistol and looked at his stop-watch. Tom
found himself getting nervous, and he wished that
Bean and his crowd would sing, but this could not
be done while the start was being made.</p>

<p>“Ready!” shouted the starter.</p>

<p>Crack! sounded the pistol a second later, and
there was a spurt of fire and smoke.</p>

<p>Tom found himself well off with the leaders,
and a hasty glance back showed Phil on even terms
with him. Tom wanted to shout an encouraging
word to his chum, but refrained as he knew he
would need his breath.</p>

<p>Tom ran as he had seldom run before. He
felt that he was in fine trim, and he almost wished
it was one of the big events of the main meet,
instead of a preliminary hurdle contest. Phil,
too, was coming on.</p>

<p>Almost abreast of Tom was Lem Sellig, Frank
Sullivan, Roger Barns, and Ted Puder of Fairview,
while, a little further on, he made out Dave
Ogden, George Stoddard, Pinkey Davenport and
Lynn Ralling of Boxer Hall. He saw a number
of the Exter lads, but did not know them by name.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">Now came the first hurdle. Tom took it easily</a>,
and went on without a break in his stride. Not so
some of the others who fell back a trifle. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
another stretch, and more hurdles. The pace was
beginning to tell on them all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<a id="image04" name="image04"><img src="images/image04.jpg" width="380" height="600"
     alt="NOW CAME THE FIRST HURDLE. TOM TOOK IT EASILY."
     title="NOW CAME THE FIRST HURDLE. TOM TOOK IT EASILY." /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_206">NOW CAME THE FIRST HURDLE. TOM TOOK IT EASILY.</a></span>
</div>

<p>There was a crash just behind Tom. He half
turned his head to look, and saw Phil go down,
his foot having caught on a top bar. But the
plucky lad was up again in a moment, though he
was hopelessly outdistanced.</p>

<p>It was over in what seemed a remarkably short
time&mdash;that first heat, the best time being a not
very remarkable performance. To Tom’s chagrin
neither he nor Phil qualified for the finals.</p>

<p>The second batch of runners came up to the
marks. Once more they were off, and the crowd
set up a cheer. Some of the Randall lads were in
this, and Bean and his crowd cheered and sung to
them to the echo. One Randallite qualified in this
round.</p>

<p>Then came two more heats until the final was
about to be run off&mdash;the one just before the big
quarter-mile race that would decide the championship
in that class.</p>

<p>“Do your prettiest!” begged Tom of Jerry
and Joe Jackson as they came to the scratch, for
they were the Randall representatives now.</p>

<p>“Sure,” they assented.</p>

<p>Once more the pistol cracked, and again the
eager lads started off. Joe was well in the lead,
taking the hurdles with an ease that surprised his
friends, and sent a wave of envy through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hearts of his rivals. Nor was Jerry far behind
him.</p>

<p>“He’ll win!” decided Tom.</p>

<p>“Give ’em something to keep ’em going!”
cried Bean to his crowd, and forth welled the
song: “There’s nothing like a Randallite to do
or die, to eat or fight!”</p>

<p>Jerry carried off for Randall first honors of
that heat, and so qualified for the final. Sid, too,
was also in the class, and with Joe Jackson and
others made up those who would try for final
honors. There were two lads from Boxer&mdash;Dave
Ogden and Pinkey Davenport&mdash;three from Fairview&mdash;Lem
Sellig, Frank Sullivan and Roger
Barns,&mdash;and two from Exter&mdash;George Birch and
Ted Morrison&mdash;who were in the final, making a
goodly crowd.</p>

<p>This was to be the supreme test, and on it depended
much, for the winner of this race would
add a goodly number of points to his college’s
total.</p>

<p>They lined up, a throbbing, eager batch of lads,
with ears on the alert for the sound of the pistol
that was to send them off.</p>

<p>Crack! it came with startling suddenness, and
they all sprang forward.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, the ‘Conquer or Die,’ song!”
yelled Bean, and the Latin song, which had helped
win many a victory under the banners of Randall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
filled the air. It came at a time when the other
college cheering crowds were silent, and produced
an unusual effect.</p>

<p>On and on rushed the hurdle racers, panting,
fighting for every inch, taking magnificent leaps,
to clear the obstacles, covering yard after yard in
long strides.</p>

<p>“Jerry’s ahead! Jerry’s ahead!” yelled Tom,
dancing about, and clapping Phil on the back until
his chum cried for mercy.</p>

<p>“Hey! Let up, will you?” Phil begged. “I
want to live to see the finish.”</p>

<p>“Sid’s falling back,” announced Holly, gloomily,
as he watched the contestants. “But Joe
Jackson is pulling up.”</p>

<p>“There goes Lem Sellig!” cried Tom, as that
lad tripped on a hurdle and fell heavily. Several
of his friends rushed out and picked him up.</p>

<p>“Go on Sid! Go on!” fairly howled Tom.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Fairview!” came a shrill
cry in girls’ voices, and Tom knew that Madge
and her chums were rallying their representatives.</p>

<p>Close behind Jerry came George Birch of Exter.
On he raced, magnificently, with a burst of speed.</p>

<p>“Look out, Jerry!” warned Holly, but it was
too late.</p>

<p>With a leap George passed his competitor, and
forged to the front. Even then Jerry might have
caught him had it not been for a slight accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a cinder sticking up, dislodged from
the smooth track by some previous runner, and
not before noticed. Jerry trod on it, and his foot
gave a twinge. He hesitated a moment, before a
hurdle, and the hesitation was fatal to his
chances.</p>

<p>He did not clear the barrier, but, though he
knocked it over he himself did not fall. But he
could not get into his stride again, and, a moment
later, he was passed by several others.</p>

<p>“Oh Sid! Sid! It’s up to you!” yelled Phil,
but it was not to be. Sid, well to the fore, was
doing his best, but he had been depending on
Jerry, and it was too late now to make the needful
spurt.</p>

<p>Over the finish line burst George Birch, carrying
the colors of Exter, and behind him came
Frank Sullivan, of Fairview, with Pinkey Davenport,
of Boxer Hall, a close third.</p>

<p>Randall had lost!</p>

<p>The echoes of the “Conquer or Die” song
rolled away, and there came a silence. It was
broken a moment later by a “locomotive-automobile”
cheer from the cohorts of Exter, and then
the other successful colleges joined in.</p>

<p>The shrill voices of the girls were heard above
the hoarser voices of their boy friends, and cheer
after cheer rolled out over the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>With tears in their eyes Phil and Frank and
Tom turned away from the track.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Holly. “Our boys
did well, but fate was against us. Better luck in
the big games.”</p>

<p>“But we needed these points,” whined Tom.</p>

<p>“I know it, you old grouch. But there’s a
chance yet, if we win most of the other events,”
declared Kindlings. “Frank, you’ve got to win
for us, and so have you, Shambler.”</p>

<p>“I will!” cried the new student, and Tom
found himself feeling more generous toward the
lad he disliked.</p>

<p>The friends of the winners crowded around
them, while those of the losers did their best to
cheer them up. Bean Perkins tried to lead his
crowd in a jolly song, but it was a failure.</p>

<p>“Let’s get our clothes on and go back,” suggested
Sid, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to see the girls?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“No,” snapped the loser. “I want to sit on
the old sofa and hear the clock tick.”</p>

<p>And that was the sentiment of the four inseparables.</p>

<p>They did not stay to see the other events run
off, but hurried back to Randall. There was
gloom in the college, but it was not hopeless, for
all felt that the other games would bring better
news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve just got to win,” declared Holly, as
he sat in the room of the four chums. “I know
we can too, for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There came a knock on the door, and Tom answered.
He found Wallops, the messenger, there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cross is wanted on the ’phone,” said
Wallops.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Holly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wallace, the athletic manager of Exter
college,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wants?” speculated Holly
as he went to answer the call.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>THE ACCUSATION</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I suppose you fellows are going to do
your share next week,” remarked Dan Woodhouse.
He had entered the room of the inseparables
shortly after Holly had gone to answer
the telephone summons.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll need every point we can pile up,”
went on the manager. “Where’s Holly, by the
way? I thought I’d find him here, and there are
a lot of things I want to talk over with him. Where
is he?”</p>

<p>They were just telling Kindlings where Holly
had gone when the lad in question came back.
There was rather a queer look on his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, you’re here,” greeted Holly.
“Come on out, I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t want us to hear; is that it?”
asked Sid with a laugh. “I like your nerve.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Dan,” went on Holly, without replying
to the chaff, and there was something in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
manner that impressed every lad in the room.
Kindlings must have noticed something, too, for
he got up quickly, and joined his chum. As he
closed the door after him, Tom and the others
heard Dan ask:</p>

<p>“What is it? What’s up? Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Holly. “I’m afraid
so. Wallace just had me on the wire. You know,
Wallace from Exter, their manager. He asked
me a queer question. Wanted to know if our
list of competitors that I mailed him for the games
next week, was to be revised.”</p>

<p>“Revised?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He asked if those were the fellows who
were going to take part in the games, and of
course I said they were. Then he came back at
me with this:</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he said, ‘I just thought I’d give you
a chance to make any change if you wanted to,
before we took action. But if it’s your last word,
all right, and you’d better come over and see me,
or I’ll come and see you.’”</p>

<p>“Wallace said that?” demanded Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Holly, “and of course I
wanted to know right away what the trouble was.
He said he couldn’t tell me over the wire, but he
was anxious for me to call, and I said I would.
He intimated that his committee might make a
protest against some of our fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“He did? Who?”</p>

<p>Tom and the others heard no more, for Dan
and Holly moved off down the corridor, but they
had caught enough to make them stare wonderingly
at each other.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” asked Tom,
slowly.</p>

<p>“That’s the limit!” exclaimed Sid. “Going
to protest against some of our fellows! Who?
And for what?”</p>

<p>No one could answer him, and for a moment
there was momentous silence.</p>

<p>“Has anyone done anything, or does anyone
know anything, that might make one of our contestants
ineligible?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Not me,” replied Tom, and the others said
the same.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and ask Dan or Holly more about
it,” suggested Sid. “We’ve heard part, and we
might as well hear all.”</p>

<p>This plan seemed to meet with general approval.
But when Tom and Phil went to find the
two managers and trainers, they were told that
they had left the college.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager they’ve gone to see Wallace,” said
Tom, as he rejoined his chums. “We’ll have to
wait until they get back.”</p>

<p>But when Holly and his chum did return, late
that night, they would not talk, though importuned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to do so by many, for the story of the possible
protesting of some of Randall’s lads had
spread.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a meeting of our committee and
Exter’s in the gymnasium to-morrow morning,”
was all the information that Holly would give out.
There were grim looks on the faces of himself
and Dan, looks that boded no good for Randall.</p>

<p>“But if they protest against some of our fellows,
and they have to withdraw, will there be
time enough to rearrange our list?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make it do,” declared Dan.
“We’ll have a few days to make good in if&mdash;well,
if some of our best men have to drop out.”</p>

<p>“But who are they?” demanded Sid. “Why
can’t we know?”</p>

<p>“Because Wallace wouldn’t tell,” was the reply.
“He said he’d make formal charges to-morrow,
and he intimated that we might post a notice,
without saying who it was, stating that some one
would be protested. His idea was that the fellow
or fellows might withdraw of their own
accord, and so save a scandal.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to post the notice?”</p>

<p>“I am not!” declared Holly decidedly. “I’m
going to bed, and that’s where all you fellows
ought to go if you want to be in shape for the
meet.”</p>

<p>It was an unpleasant night for many at Randall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and anxious faces were noted on all sides at
chapel the next morning. Wallace, and some of
his fellow committee members, came over from
Exter early, and soon all who could, by hook or
crook, “cut” a lecture, were in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” began Holly, who took the chair,
“I guess you all know what we’re here for. Mr.
Wallace, of Exter, has an announcement to make,
I understand.”</p>

<p>Wallace arose, rather pale, and began at once.</p>

<p>“Fellows of Randall,” he said, “I’d give a
good deal not to have to do this, but I believe it
to be my duty. You all know that your college
and ours, and two others are in a four-sided league
for some games. The games are strictly amateur
contests, as you all know, and amateur rules prevail.
That is, no professionals are to be allowed.”</p>

<p>There was a gasp of surprise at this, and Tom,
who was looking across the room, saw a movement
among some lads seated near Shambler.</p>

<p>“None but amateurs are to be allowed to compete,
under the rules,” went on Wallace, “not
only for the sake of the colleges themselves, but
for the contestants too. We don’t any of us want
to lay ourselves open to charges by the A. A. U.
of competing with professionals, and so be barred
out of future games.</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry to do what I have to do,
but certain information has been laid before me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
affecting the standing of two members of Randall
who are on the lists to compete in the games
soon to be held. I got the big list yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>“Name ’em!”</p>

<p>“It’s not true!”</p>

<p>These cries were heard, among other confusing
ones, as the Exter manager paused.</p>

<p>“I’ll name them now,” shouted Wallace. “I
formally charge that Jacob Shambler is a professional
ball player, that he has played in a number
of games for money, and that he has taken part
in other sports as a professional. I claim that he
was asked to leave Harkness college for that
reason, and if he is to take part under the colors
of Randall, then every Exter man will refuse to
compete. I can prove what I have said, and if
Mr. Shambler is present I challenge him to stand
up and refute what I have charged!”</p>

<p>If a cannon had been fired in the room, it could
not have produced more of an effect, nor brought
about a more stunning silence following Wallace’s
charge. Every eye was turned toward where
Shambler had been observed to be sitting.</p>

<p>“Is it true?”</p>

<p>“It can’t be!”</p>

<p>“There’s some mistake!”</p>

<p>“Shambler, answer him&mdash;tell him it isn’t so!”</p>

<p>These cries followed each other in rapid succession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Tom was aware of many thoughts flying
in confusion through his brain. Several suspicious
circumstances in regard to Shambler seemed likely
to be explained now.</p>

<p>“Shambler, will you answer?” called Holly,
in strained tones. “Can’t you say, for the honor
of Randall, that this isn’t so?”</p>

<p>There was a hush of silence, and, as white as
a sheet of paper, the student on whom so much
depended&mdash;who it was hoped would win the big
mile run, and perhaps other contests for the college,
arose.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, and members of Randall,” he
began, and then his voice broke. “I&mdash;I can’t say
anything!” he faltered.</p>

<p>Once more that tense silence.</p>

<p>“Is it&mdash;is it true?” hoarsely asked Kindlings.
“Are you a professional?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am,” confessed Jake Shambler and then,
amid a storm of hisses which broke out all over
the room, the dishonored student hurried out.
He had not dared to deny the charge.</p>

<p>“The sneak!” cried several, and more than
one arose as though to follow and inflict corporal
punishment on one who had trailed the colors of
Randall in the dust.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried Holly Cross, leaping to his
feet. “It’s bad enough without making it worse.
Stop that hissing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>It stopped instantly, and amid a death-like
silence Shambler opened the door of the gymnasium,
and walked out. He did not look back.
No one at Randall saw him again, for he left
hurriedly, not even stopping to get his belongings.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>A DISPUTED POINT</small></h2>


<p>For a few moments after the dramatic withdrawal
of Shambler, following his practical confession
of guilt, no one spoke, and no one seemed
to know what to do. Then Wallace, who acted
well his part under the trying circumstances, again
arose.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you fellows of Randall how we
hated to do this,” he said. “But we felt it to be
our duty&mdash;our duty toward ourselves as well as
toward you and the other colleges.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I&mdash;I guess it had to be done,” admitted
Holly, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“I suppose there is no doubt about it&mdash;the
charge of professionalism,” suggested Dan Woodhouse
gently.</p>

<p>“None whatever, I’m sorry to say,” went on
Wallace. “The first intimation I had was when
Jack Pendleton and Hal Durkin, two of our players,
spoke to me about it, after they saw Shambler,
the other day. He goes by that name now, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he played as a professional under the name of
Jacobs.”</p>

<p>“As soon as Durkin and Pendleton told me
their suspicions I began to make inquiries,” went
on Wallace, “and I soon found that they were
right. Here is a picture of the professional nine
with which Shambler played,” and he held up a
sporting paper, with a black ink mark around the
left-fielder. The boys crowded up to look at it,
and recognized Shambler at once.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Tom, “that’s the same
paper that we saw Shambler have in the reading
room one day&mdash;the paper that he tore a picture
from! It was his own likeness, and he was afraid
we’d recognize him.”</p>

<p>Several recalled that incident.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s nothing else to be said,” admitted
Holly with a sigh. “I suppose I needn’t
assure you Exter fellows that we knew nothing of
this,” he added quickly. “We never would have
admitted Shambler to the contests if we had
dreamed of such a charge hanging over him.”</p>

<p>“We know that,” Wallace assured him quietly.
“It’s too bad, but there’s no harm done. Do we
understand that you withdraw Shambler’s name?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” exclaimed Kindlings. “It’s too bad,
for he is a fine athlete. I’m glad, now, he wasn’t
in the hurdle race.”</p>

<p>“I guess he got in the wrong kind of company,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
went on Wallace. “I understand he has been seen
several times of late with a fellow named Nelson.
He, too, is a professional, but he has been barred
from even his own class because of cheating. He
helped Shambler train.”</p>

<p>“Nelson,” mused Tom. “That must be the
fellow I saw with Shambler, and the one I heard
him talking to.” It developed later that this was
so.</p>

<p>Wallace laid before the committee several other
items of proof of the charge he had made. They
tended to show that Shambler had been one of the
best amateur all-round athletes in the West. But
he began going with a “sporty” set, and, needing
more money than his folks could supply him, he
accepted the invitation of a professional ball
team to play for them one Summer. He managed
to conceal the fact and returned to his college as
an amateur until chance betrayed him. Then,
having found in professional athletics a comparatively
easy way to make money, he continued along
that line, coming to Randall under false colors.</p>

<p>It was believed that he intended doing as he
had often done before, secretly placing bets
through Nelson, and so clearing a tidy sum.
Wallace showed Shambler’s professional record in
several events, and in every case the time, or distance,
made was much better than the record of
Shambler at Randall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Wallace hesitated a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“This case is not half as serious as the other,
and we would not bring it up except that we feel
that you would not want to enter a contestant
against whom there was the least hint of professionalism.
Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” declared Holly grimly. “Out with
it, I guess we can take our medicine. I hope it
isn’t myself.”</p>

<p>Probably not a lad present was prepared for
what followed.</p>

<p>“It is a sad duty, but one I feel I have to do,”
went on the Exter manager, “when I say that
Frank Simpson is also under the ban of professionalism.”</p>

<p>“Frank Simpson!” gasped a score of voices.</p>

<p>“The big Californian!” added others.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Tom, as if he had not
heard aright.</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible!” fairly yelled Phil Clinton,
as he leaped to his feet and held out his hand to
Frank, who sat beside him. “I’ll stake anything
on Frank.”</p>

<p>“So will I!” cried Tom and Sid. Wallace remained
calmly looking at the lad against whom
he had brought the ugly charge.</p>

<p>“Frank, answer him!” implored Tom pleadingly.</p>

<p>For a moment Frank had been so plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
stunned and surprised by the accusation that he
did not know what to do. Then he slowly got up.</p>

<p>“I wish to say, most emphatically,” he began
in a calm voice, “that Mr. Wallace is mistaken.
He has either confused me with someone else, or
his information is at fault. I am not a professional,
I never have been one, I never intend to
become one. I never took part in any professional
games, and I never received any money for playing
ball, or in any other contest. I can’t make
that too strong!”</p>

<p>“Hurray!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!”</p>

<p>“Now we’re coming back at ’em!”</p>

<p>Amid a babble of cries these were heard. There
were angry looks cast at the Exter committee,
and one or two lads started from their seats, and
worked their way forward, as though to be in the
fore when hostilities commenced.</p>

<p>Wallace stood there, calm and collected. He
looked at Frank, who returned the gaze undismayed
and unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“Do you insist, after Mr. Simpson’s denial,
that you are right?” asked Holly, when there was
silence.</p>

<p>“I am sorry&mdash;but&mdash;I do,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>There was a storm of hisses, but Holly stopped
them with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“And when I say that, I do not in the least
mean to reflect on Mr. Simpson’s word,” said
Wallace courteously. “I think he forgets, that is
all, and I will proceed to give the facts. It is no
pleasure to do this,” he went on, “but duty very
seldom is pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, old man, don’t mind me,” said
Frank with a smile. “My conscience is clear.
I think you’re mistaken&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was,” replied the Exter lad. “But
I have information that you took part, as a professional,
in some games held on the Fourth of
July, three years ago, in a park outside of San
Francisco, California. In particular you took
part in a running race, and you were paid the sum
of fifty dollars. The affair was for some hospital
or other charity, and there were a number of
other semi-professionals who took part in it. Do
you deny that?”</p>

<p>For a moment several thought that Frank
Simpson would collapse, so surprised was he.
Then he braced himself by a strong effort, and
tried to speak. For a second or two no words
would come, and then, in a husky voice he said:</p>

<p>“Part of that is true, and part is not. I did
take part in those games, but it was strictly as an
amateur. I can prove that. I have never been a
professional.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it true that you won the mile run?”
asked Wallace.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“And wasn’t the first prize for that contest
fifty dollars in gold?”</p>

<p>“It was, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you win, and get the prize?”</p>

<p>“I won, but I did not get the money!” fairly
shouted Frank. “I never had a cent of it. I did
win the race. The prize was fifty dollars, but I
never got it. I turned it over, without even taking
it into my possession, to the charitable committee.
If that’s professionalism, make the most of it!”</p>

<p>He sat down, and every lad in the room was on
his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>“Of course that’s not professionalism!”</p>

<p>“Never heard of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“That’s a silly charge!”</p>

<p>“The A. A. U. rules don’t make that professionalism!”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!”</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be shouting something,
and Holly managed to hear the above expressions,
amid the babble of others.</p>

<p>“Silence! Silence!” he cried.</p>

<p>“That’s our case,” Wallace managed to say.</p>

<p>Once more came hisses, that were not so easy
to silence.</p>

<p>“We claim that is professionalism, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
won’t compete if Frank Simpson represents Randall,”
said Pendleton, who stood beside Wallace.</p>

<p>“It seems like splitting hairs,” spoke Kindlings,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it does,” admitted Wallace calmly.
“But we claim that Simpson is a professional
under the rules. It’s up to you fellows, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I move that the athletic committee
of Randall go into executive session at once,
consider this matter, and let Exter have our answer
as soon as possible,” shouted Tom above the
din.</p>

<p>“Second the motion!” cried Sid.</p>

<p>It was put and carried at once.</p>

<p>“Will you make yourselves comfortable until
after our session?” asked Holly of the Exter
committee. “I’ll have you taken to our chapter
house,” and he called some lads, who were not
members of the committee, to act as the hosts of
the visitors.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>FRANK WITHDRAWS</small></h2>


<p>Tense and anxious faces looked into those of
Holly and Kindlings as the athletic committee
drew closer to the platform in the gymnasium.
The doors were closed. The Exter lads had
been taken in charge by some Randall fraternity
members, but it could not be said that there was
a spirit of gaiety observable. Only those of
whom it was absolutely required attended lectures.
The others, not charged with the extending
of courtesies to the Exter lads, hung about
the gymnasium, waiting for any news that might
leak out.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, what’s to be done?” asked Holly,
rather helplessly, as he faced his committee.
Tom, Sid, Phil and Frank, of course, were present.</p>

<p>“Who’s got anything to suggest?” asked Dan
Woodhouse.</p>

<p>It seemed that the two trainers and managers
were all at sea, as, indeed, were most of the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suggest that Frank tells us all he knows
about this case,” said Tom, finally. “We’re with
him to the last. I guess I needn’t say that,
though,” he added.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in several others.</p>

<p>Frank arose, all eyes turned toward him.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he began, “I can’t tell you how
sorry I am that this thing has come to you. It’s
like a bolt out of a clear sky to me, and I needn’t
say that I never dreamed of such a charge being
brought.”</p>

<p>“We know it,” said someone.</p>

<p>“If I was surprised when the charge was made
against Shambler&mdash;and he admitted it was true,”
went on the Big Californian. “I was completely
astounded when they named me as the second
man. I hardly know what to say.”</p>

<p>“Did you really take part in those games?”
asked Holly.</p>

<p>“I did, but there was not the least hint of
professionalism. No one dreamed of such a
thing. As I recollect it, a number of college fellows
were asked to compete. I was at Stanford
University at the time. I entered. It was for
some charity. I’ve forgotten just what now, but
a hospital, I think. A business men’s committee
was formed, and I was told there were to be
several prizes offered for contestants. We didn’t
care about them, for we only thought of doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
our best and winning. We all supposed the prizes
would be medals, cups, or something like that.</p>

<p>“Then there was some talk of money prizes
being offered. But I don’t believe any of us
thought anything about it being professional to
compete for money, but I know we college fellows
held a meeting.</p>

<p>“We decided unanimously that whatever
prizes we won we would donate to the charity for
which the contests were run off. None of us
wanted them. Then came the meet.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just how many events I took
part in. I think I won the pole vault, as well as
the mile run, but I’m not sure. Anyhow, I know
that after the games a man came up to me, and
some of the other winners, with envelopes. I
realize now that they must have contained money&mdash;the
prize money.</p>

<p>“Everyone of us waved him aside, and the
general order was: ‘Give it to the hospital,’ if it
was a hospital for which the meet was held. I
know I never accepted a cent, and none of the
other college fellows did. That’s all there is to
it.”</p>

<p>There was a short period of silence following
the statement by the Big Californian. Then Tom
arose in his seat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman,” he said, “I move you that
we take a vote of confidence in Frank, first of all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and then that we send word to Exter and Boxer
Hall and Fairview, that the charges of professionalism
are groundless in this case, and that
Frank will take part in the games.”</p>

<p>“Second it!” yelled Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>“One minute,” began Holly calmly. “I appreciate
the spirit in which that motion was made,
and I’ll put it at the proper time. But, before I
do, I’d like to know if anyone here has a copy of
the A. A. U. rules bearing on professionalism.
If he has will he see if they bear on this case?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a copy!” said Dan Woodhouse,
“and I know ’em pretty much by heart. I don’t
believe that Frank would be barred under the
rules. They make the ‘acceptance’ of money a
bar, I think, and by his own evidence Frank didn’t
accept it.”</p>

<p>“Not that I want to seem to believe for a moment
this charge, but because I think we ought
to be very sure of our ground, I make this suggestion,”
spoke Phil Clinton. “Of course Frank
didn’t take, or accept, the money. But might it
not be said that by tacitly turning it over to the
charity after winning it, that he had it? I’m
afraid they’ll say&mdash;the committee I mean&mdash;that
when he competed for a money prize he became
a professional.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” cried several.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one way of looking at it,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Holly Cross. “That’s what we’re here to decide.
Shall we fight this case, and have it threshed out
in a general meeting, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fight! Fight!” cried a number.</p>

<p>“Frank isn’t a professional, and never was,”
declared Sid Henderson, jumping up and excitedly
waving his arms. “I say let’s defy Exter and all
the rest.”</p>

<p>“And maybe break up the meet?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Fellows, let me speak once more,” begged
Frank. “I have thought this matter over carefully
in the last few minutes, and, while I don’t
retreat one point from my position, perhaps a
compromise would be better than a contest.”</p>

<p>“No! No! Contest it!” was the general cry.</p>

<p>“Wait!” begged the lad who had most at
stake. “This comes at an unfortunate moment.
Shambler confessed that he was a professional.
Fortunately it came in time to save the honor of
Randall. Now, what I propose to do is for the
further honor of our college.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Frank Simpson?”
demanded Bean Perkins.</p>

<p>“He’s&mdash;all&mdash;right!” was thundered out.</p>

<p>“Thank you, boys,” responded the Big Californian,
when quiet had been restored. “I appreciate
all that, but we must face the facts. As
soon as it becomes known that Shambler has confessed,
there will be a lot of talk. Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Randall can’t be scorned. We have done our
duty. Now there’s this charge against me. There
are some complications in it. I believe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A fair committee would never bar you,”
broke in Tom.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” admitted Frank. “But we
don’t want any question raised. Boys,” he went
on, and his voice was solemn, “we have to think
of the honor of Randall before we think of ourselves.
It’s the college and not the contestants
who will be exalted, or dragged down, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>“I fully believe that I am in the right, and
that no charge of professionalism would stand
against me. But, for the honor of Randall I want
you to let me withdraw. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No! No!” came a storm of protests.</p>

<p>“Stick it out!” urged Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>“We’re with you to the end,” added Phil.</p>

<p>Frank raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you to say that,” he went
on, when he could be heard, “but I know how
these things sometimes turn out. There is talk
afterward. You don’t want the success of Randall
questioned, in case she should win this meet.”</p>

<p>“But can we win with you and Shambler out?”
someone asked.</p>

<p>“Boys, you’ve got to&mdash;for the honor of Randall,”
said Frank quietly. “You’ve just got to!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
You’ve got to let me drop out, and someone must
take my place. It can be done, easily. Someone
must run for Shambler, too. I know it’s going
to be hard to get someone with his record, but
we’ll do it. Boys, I’m not going to take part in
the games. That’s final!”</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that they all expected this
as a climax to what Frank had started to say, it
came as a shock. There was a tense silence, and
then someone asked:</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a way out? We need you, Simpson.”</p>

<p>“There is no way out, except my resignation,”
answered Frank, “and I hereby tender it now,
formally, and ask that it be accepted at once.
Then you can go into the games with a clean
slate, and&mdash;win!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>“WHAT’S TO BE DONE?”</small></h2>


<p>For perhaps five seconds no one spoke after
Frank had announced his decision, a decision that
meant more to him than anyone suspected. Then
there came a spontaneous cheer&mdash;a cheer for the
lad who could sacrifice himself for the honor of
his college.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Frank Simpson?”
again demanded Bean Perkins.</p>

<p>Instantly came the answer:</p>

<p>“He’s all right!”</p>

<p>“Tiger!” yelled the irrepressible Bean, and
the yellow-striped cheer was given with a will.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose there’s nothing else to be
done,” spoke Holly, regretfully.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Frank, and the wonder of
it was that he could smile. “Nothing but to accept
my withdrawal, and so inform the committee
from Exter.”</p>

<p>“And then we’ve got to get busy and see who
we can put in your place, and Shambler’s,” added
Kindlings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The resignation was formally accepted, and
word was sent to Wallace and his friends. They
expressed their regret at the necessity, and even
admitted that perhaps a ruling from the A. A. U.
might bear out Frank’s contention that he was
not a professional.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t time for it,” said Holly.
“We’ll take our medicine, though it’s a bitter pill
to swallow.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t think we did this because
of any fear on our part that we couldn’t win
against your two men,” spoke the Exter manager.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Holly assured him. “I appreciate
your position, but it’s tough on us, to lose
two good men. I can’t get over that cad Shambler.”</p>

<p>“He certainly played a mean part,” agreed
Wallace. “This Simpson’s case is altogether different.
I’m sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“We all are,” put in Kindlings. “Well, we’ve
got a little time left in which to make good. I’m
glad we don’t have to go into the games to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Not wishing you any bad luck,” spoke the
Exter lad, with a frank laugh, “I hope we beat
you.”</p>

<p>“Randall is hard to beat,” spoke Holly grimly.
“You’ll find us on the job when the time comes.”</p>

<p>But when the protesting committee had left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
boys of Randall looked at each other with
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” was the general question.</p>

<p>No one could answer.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ve got to go on and play the
game,” declared Holly Cross. “We’ve a few
days in which to select some lads to take the places
of Shambler and Frank. Oh, why couldn’t it have
been someone else? This leaves the mile run and
the broad jump open, and we were counting on
those two contests especially. Of the others I’m
not so much afraid. But who are we going to
enter for those contests?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to lose, I think,” said Jerry
Jackson mournfully.</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;lose,” echoed his twin.</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows make me tired!” exploded
Kindlings. “We’re <em>not</em> going to lose!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk, but how do you figure
it out?” asked Holly. “Who’ll substitute for
Shambler and Frank?”</p>

<p>“Sid Henderson will have to make the jump,
and Tom Parsons, we’ll depend on you for the
mile run!” answered Dan quickly.</p>

<p>“Who, me? I can never beat the Exter man
in the jump,” asserted Sid.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t you talk back to me!” retorted
Kindlings, and there was a new note in his voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
“I tell you you’re going to do it! Where’s
Parsons?”</p>

<p>“Here,” answered Tom meekly.</p>

<p>“You get into practice quick for that mile
run,” ordered Dan. “You’ve got to do it. Sid,
get into your togs at once. Holly, come on out
and hold the watch on Tom. I’ll see Moses and
make it all right about lectures. We’re in a hole
and we’ve got to pull ourselves out.”</p>

<p>At once it seemed as if new spirit had settled
down over Randall. There had been gloom, following
the withdrawal of Shambler and Frank,
but with the manly way in which Kindlings met
the situation the skies seemed to clear.</p>

<p>It was the only way out of the dilemma. But
everyone knew that, at best, it was but a slim
chance. Neither Tom nor Sid were brilliant performers,
though that is not saying they were to
be despised, by any means. Their talents simply
lay in other directions than track athletics. Yet
they were not far behind Frank and Shambler
in the two events. They needed hard training,
however, and the question was, could they get in
form in the short time left?</p>

<p>“They’ve got to!” declared Kindlings grimly.
“It’s going to be train&mdash;train&mdash;train! from now
to the minute of the games. It means a lot of
practice&mdash;hard practice. Oh, if we only had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
week more! Why didn’t this come a little
sooner?”</p>

<p>“Is there any chance of getting a postponement?”
asked Phil. “I think under the circumstances
we’re entitled to it.”</p>

<p>“Entitled to it, yes, maybe,” assented Dan,
“but we won’t crawl by asking for it. We’ll take
our medicine, and take it like men, and, what’s
more, we’ll turn the trick, too!”</p>

<p>The squad of athletes was ordered out soon
after the momentous meeting. Dr. Churchill met
the situation squarely. He gave the boys all the
leeway needed in the matter of attending lectures,
and wrote a personal letter to the heads of Exter,
Boxer Hall and Fairview, expressing regret at the
turn of affairs.</p>

<p>And then Randall grimly set to work on her
uphill climb.</p>

<p>That it was to be an uphill climb was soon
made very evident. Whether it was because of
nervousness, or real inability to make good, or because
they were so suddenly called on without
adequate preparation, was not made evident, but
certain it was that neither Tom nor Sid gave
brilliant performances in the trials that followed.
Tom’s time was far behind that of Shambler in
the mile run, and, though it was only a matter of
seconds, everyone knew that seconds would count.</p>

<p>Sid, too, seemed to have lost his natural ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to cover ground in the big jump, though he was
by far the best man available after Frank’s disbarment.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” declared Holly, and though
his heart was sinking, he kept up a bold front.
“Get at it, boys,” he urged the two on whom so
much depended. “You can make good yet! All
you need is to think so.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to say,” complained Tom,
who was tired from many trials.</p>

<p>“Say, if you don’t win, I’ll roll you in the mud
so your best girl won’t speak to you for a month,”
threatened Kindlings. “And, as for you, Sid,
I’ll have you run out of Randall on a rail. So
make good&mdash;both of you!”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Tom, disconsolately, and Sid
looked at him with despair in his eyes. They
were both in a bad way.</p>

<p>There was but one more day before the games.
It dawned&mdash;or rather, to quote Holly Cross, “it
clouded up beautifully” from the start. There
was a chill, in the air, too.</p>

<p>“Tumble out!” cried Kindlings, as he banged
on the door of the room where the inseparables
were sleeping. “Tom&mdash;Sid, we need you for
some morning practice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on away,” begged Tom.</p>

<p>“Let me dream on,” requested Sid, drowsily.</p>

<p>“Tumble out!” shouted the inexorable Kindlings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
“This is your last chance. It’s a nice cool
morning for a run or a jump, and you’ll be all the
better for it. Come on.”</p>

<p>So, perforce, the substitutes who were to fill
in for Frank and Shambler “tumbled out,” literally,
for they were half asleep. But a shower
bath, a brisk rub, and the cheerful talk of Holly
and Kindlings put new life into them, and soon
they were at vigorous practice. They did better
than on the previous day.</p>

<p>“If we only had another week, or even three
days, I wouldn’t be a bit worried,” declared Holly
at the conclusion of the trials. “They’re both
doing fine, Kindlings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose we can get an extension?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have the nerve to ask for it.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to stand or fall as we are.”</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;hang together or hang separately
as Patrick Henry, or some of the ancients, said,”
quoted Holly.</p>

<p>The excitement over the unexpected charges
had somewhat died away, and Randall was more
like herself. The withdrawal of Shambler had
created a little flurry, but not much. No one
seemed to know where he had gone, and no word
came as to what to do with his effects.</p>

<p>As for Frank, he was saddened, but not downcast.
He announced his intention of taking up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
case with the Amateur Athletic Union as soon as
the games were completed.</p>

<p>“I’m sure they’ll uphold my contention,” he
declared. “I’m an amateur, and I can prove it!”</p>

<p>“But it will be too late for any use,” spoke
Tom mournfully.</p>

<p>Words of sympathy had come from the girls,
and Tom and his chums were duly grateful for
them. It developed that neither Boxer Hall nor
Fairview were in favor of forcing the issue against
Randall, but that Exter, with perhaps exaggerated
notions as to what constituted “amateur” sport,
had taken the initiative. Still Randall’s lads did
not complain.</p>

<p>It was the night before the big games. Gathered
in the room of the inseparables were our
old friends, Holly, Kindlings, Dutch, and a few
other kindred spirits.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all over but the shouting,” said
Dutch, in mournful tones. “To-morrow will tell
the tale.”</p>

<p>“Get out, you old croaker!” cried Kindlings.</p>

<p>“We’re going to win! I’m sure of it!”</p>

<p>“If we had another week, I believe we would,”
asserted Holly. “Tom and Sid could pull up by
then. I’m almost tempted to telephone, even at
this late day, and ask for a postponement. We’re
entitled to it, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” advised Phil. “Be a sport!
Play the game!”</p>

<p>“Just the same I wish something would happen
to put things off until next Saturday,” insisted
Holly.</p>

<p>“It’s too late now,” declared Kindlings.
“We’ve got to take part to-morrow unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and held up his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom, curiously.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Dan. “What’s that
noise?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>A BOTTLE OF MEDICINE</small></h2>


<p>They all listened intently, looking the while
curiously at Kindlings. He seemed to be hearing
something inaudible to the others.</p>

<p>“I don’t ‘hark’ to anything,” remarked Tom,
“unless you mean a sort of pattering noise,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” interrupted Dan with a glad cry.
“It’s the pattering noise I mean. Fellows, there’s
a way out after all. It’s raining, and if it keeps up
long enough the games will have to be called off.
Now, if any of you have any sort of pull with the
weather man have him make it rain like the old
scratch, and keep it up. It’s our only salvation.
A postponement means a week, and in that time
Tom and Sid will be fit as fiddles. Come on, oh
you rain drops!”</p>

<p>For a moment or two the students all stared
at Dan as though they thought he had taken
leave of his senses. Then, as the patter on the
window ledge outside became more pronounced,
and as the gentle shower became a veritable downpour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
all understood Dan’s elation. Postponement&mdash;delay&mdash;was
the thing they needed most of
all, and it seemed likely to be their luck.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it only lasts!” half-whispered Tom.
“If it isn’t just a little shower, that will only lay
the dust!”</p>

<p>Dan jumped up, and made his way to the window,
shoving Phil to one side so forcibly that he
toppled into one of the armchairs, with impact
enough to almost wreck it.</p>

<p>“Hey! Look out what you’re doing!” cried
Phil. “What are you up to, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to stick my head out, and get
soaked, then maybe the rain-god will take that as
a sort of votive offering, and keep the faucets
turned on all night,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a downpour harder
than ever, and as he thrust forth his head he was
drenched in an instant.</p>

<p>“I guess it’ll keep up all night,” he remarked.
“It seems a mean thing to wish, perhaps, for it
will spoil a lot of people’s fun, and the other
colleges won’t like the postponement, but it’s
Randall’s only hope. Rain on! Rain on!”</p>

<p>And rain it did, with increasing violence.</p>

<p>“How’s the wind?” asked Tom, with a memory
of the days spent on the farm, when the
weather was a fruitful source of talk, and when
much depended on reading the signs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t see it,” replied Dan. “Besides, what
difference does that make?”</p>

<p>“Lots,” replied Tom shortly. “Let me take
a look. If we’ve got a good east wind it means
a long rain.”</p>

<p>He thrust his head out of the open window,
into the darkness and storm, while his chums
awaited his verdict.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he announced after a moment.
“It’s in the east. There’ll be no games to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got good eyes, to see wind in the
dark,” remarked Sid.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it&mdash;I felt it, you amiable cow,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p>For a time they listened to the patter of the
drops that meant so much to Randall, and then
the gathering broke up, the visitors going to their
rooms, leaving the inseparables to themselves.</p>

<p>It rained all night, and was still at it when
morning broke. Several times during the night
Tom, or some of his chums, got up to see if the
storm was still doing its duty, and when they
found that it was, they returned to rest with
sighs of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing to do but call the
games off. Boxer Hall and Fairview, to whom
Holly telephoned early in the day, agreed to this.
Exter held off, her manager saying he thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
might clear. Perhaps he realized what the delay
meant to his rivals. But even he had to give in
finally, and formal announcement of the postponement
was made, it being stated that all tickets
would be good the following Saturday.</p>

<p>“And now, Tom and Sid, you’ve got to train
your heads off and be fit to the minute,” declared
Holly. “Into the gym until it clears, and you
won’t have any rest as soon as it’s dry enough to
get on the track.”</p>

<p>“We’ll sacrifice ourselves on the altar of duty,”
replied Tom, mockly-heroic.</p>

<p>“And you ought to be glad of the chance,”
retorted Phil. “I wish I was in your place.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how sorry I am that this
trouble occurred,” said Frank to his two friends
and some of the others as they were gathered in
the room of the inseparables the afternoon of
the day when the games were to have been held,
and while it was still pouring. “I feel as if I
ought to have spoken of the chance of the professional
charge being brought against me, and then
I could have kept out. But I never dreamed of
it. There never would have been any question of
Randall’s honor then.”</p>

<p>“And there isn’t now,” declared Kindlings
sturdily. “It’s all right for those fellows to take
the stand they did, but I don’t believe they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
right in your case, Frank, and I don’t propose to
let the matter rest there.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Phil, as
he shook the alarm clock to cure it of a spasm of
stopping that had developed that day. “Are
you going to raise a row over it?”</p>

<p>“Not a row, but I’m going to write to the heads
of the A. A. U. and state the case. Then I’m
going to ask if Frank can be regarded as a professional.
This can’t stop here. We need Frank
for something else besides these games. We
may have a rowing crew this year, or next; besides,
there’s football and baseball to consider.
I’m going to the bottom of this thing.”</p>

<p>“And I’m glad of it,” declared the Big Californian.
“I don’t want this charge hanging over
me, and if you hadn’t asked for a ruling I would.
But it’s better to come from you, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And to think that now, if something hadn’t
happened, we might be sitting here, trying to
figure out how we lost, if the games had been
held,” remarked Sid, as he listened to the rain.</p>

<p>It rained all the next day&mdash;Sunday&mdash;which had
the effect of keeping the lads indoors, making
them fret, for they were all lovers of fresh air,
and were seldom in their rooms except to study
or sleep. In the afternoon Tom and the other
three, in their raincoats, braved the downpour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which had suddenly increased, and paid a visit to
the girls at Fairview.</p>

<p>“I believe you boys did this on purpose,” challenged
Madge, as they talked about the rain and
the postponement.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell anybody&mdash;but we did,” whispered
Tom with a smile. “The rain spells success for
Randall.”</p>

<p>The girls denied it, of course, but in spite of the
jokes of our heroes there was more or less of a
feeling that Tom was right. The Fairview boys
fretted over the delay, but were good-natured
about it.</p>

<p>Toward evening the rain slacked up a little,
and the girls granted the entreaties of the boys
to come out for a walk, Miss Philock according
the necessary permission rather grudgingly.</p>

<p>It was too wet on Monday for out-door work,
and Tom, Sid, and the others kept to the gymnasium.
There was a grim spirit about the work
now, for the boys felt that chance had played into
their hands and if they did not take advantage of
it that there would be no more hope for them.</p>

<p>“Luck doesn’t strike twice in the same place,
even if lightning does, the proverb to the contrary,”
said Holly Cross.</p>

<p>Tom had a letter from his father that day,
announcing that the final hearing in the lawsuit
might come off any day now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And I wish I could know how it’s coming out,”
Mr. Parsons wrote to his son. “It has me
bothered and worried more than a little. I don’t
want to take you out of college, Tom, my boy,
but I’ll have to if I lose all this money. I may
need you to testify in the case, but if I do I suppose
I can reach you by telegram. If you do get
a wire, don’t delay.”</p></div>

<p>“Wow!” mused Tom, as he read that. “I
hope dad doesn’t send for me before the games.
Not that I’m such a muchness, but it would sort
of break up the combination if I had to leave
suddenly. Well, there’s no help for it. If I have
to go, I’ll have to go. If I don’t, in case dad
should telegraph for me, he might lose the case,
and I’d have to leave Randall.</p>

<p>“And yet if I left we might lose this contest.
I wonder what is better to do? Delay, in case
dad sends for me, and help Randall win, which
may mean that I’m down and out afterward, or
take a chance on Randall losing, so I can come
back? Pshaw! Of course I’ve got to help win,
no matter if I can’t come back. And yet for dad
to lose all that money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang it all! I don’t know what to do!” burst
out Tom. “I’m not going to think any more
about it. I’ll wait until the time comes, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
dad does telegraph, I’ll tell the boys about it, and
see what they say.”</p>

<p>Then Tom resolutely put the affair as much out
of his thoughts as he could, for he found it interfering
with his practice and training, and he knew
that he must bend every energy to win the mile
run.</p>

<p>The practice went on unceasingly. The weather
cleared, being finer than ever, and the candidates
went out on the track and field.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Holly and Kindlings had composed
a letter to the proper authorities of the Amateur
Athletic Union, asking a ruling on Frank’s case.
Nothing more had been heard from Shambler,
excepting that he had sent for his baggage, and it
was surmised that he had quietly taken himself
to parts unknown.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday afternoon, and Tom, coming
from the gymnasium, after a refreshing
shower, following a hard spell of practice in all-around
work, was met by Wallops.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Parsons,” said the messenger,
“there was a young man looking for you, with a
package a while ago. I couldn’t find you, so I
sent him to your room with it. I guess he left it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it wasn’t a telegram?” asked
our hero anxiously, thinking of his father’s lawsuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, it was a package. It came by express, he
said.”</p>

<p>“All right, Wallops. I’ll look out for it. Did
you pay anything on it?”</p>

<p>“No, it was prepaid. I say, Mr. Parsons, do
you think we’re going to win the championship?”
and the diminutive messenger looked at the runner
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course we are, Wallops. Why? You
aren’t betting, I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, but you see&mdash;well, er&mdash;yes, I am in a
way. A friend of mine bet a box of candy&mdash;I
mean I bet the box of candy and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And <em>she</em> wagered a necktie, I suppose,” interrupted
Tom with a laugh. “Well, Wallops, I
hope the young lady bet on us, and that you lose,
though I’d buy her the candy, if I were you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mr. Parsons, I guess I will,” answered
the messenger with a cheerful grin. “She’s
an awful nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” mused Tom, as he walked on.
“Every fellow thinks that I suppose, about his
own. But I wonder what that package is?”</p>

<p>He found it outside the door, which was locked.
None of his chums was in as Tom swung the portal,
and soon he was unwrapping the bundle.</p>

<p>“Ha! A bottle of medicine,” remarked Tom,
as the last paper came off, revealing a flask of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
some dark fluid. “I wonder who could have sent
it to me?”</p>

<p>He looked at the wrapper, but it bore no
sender’s name, and his own address was in typewriting.</p>

<p>“Hello! What you got?” demanded Sid, as
he entered at that moment, and saw Tom holding
the bottle up to the light.</p>

<p>“Search me,” was the answer. “It’s a bottle
of some kind of training dope I guess, to judge
by the label.”</p>

<p>Sid looked at it.</p>

<p>“That’s good stuff,” he announced. “It’s a
sort of iron tonic. I’ve used it. It’s a patent
medicine, but lots of fellows use it in training.
Who sent it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Sid looked at the wrapper.</p>

<p>“It came from Fairview,” he declared. “Tom,
some of the girls thought you were losing your
nerve, and they sent this. Well, a dose of it
won’t hurt you. They meant all right, I guess.
Going to take any? It’s fine for the stomach.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t feel the need of it,” and Tom set
the bottle of medicine on the shelf.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>AN ALARM IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“What are you doing, Sid?”</p>

<p>“Writing a letter.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I can see that without glasses.
But who to, if it’s not a personal question?”
persisted Tom tantalizingly, as he stretched out
on the old couch, and watched his chum busy with
pen and ink. Phil and Frank were making more
or less successful pretenses at study.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;it <em>is</em> sort of personal,” replied
Sid, and Tom noticed that the writer got red
back of the ears. That is always regarded as a
sure sign.</p>

<p>“My! You’ve got it bad,” persisted Tom.</p>

<p>“Got what bad&mdash;what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“As if you didn’t know! You saw her Sunday,
and here it is only Wednesday, and you’re writing.
I say, that’s against the union rules you know;
how about it fellows?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p>“And the punishment is that you’ll have to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the letter to us,” went on Tom. “Failing to do
that we will read it for ourselves.”</p>

<p>He arose suddenly, and made as if to look
over Sid’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried the writer, dodging
away from the table. “You let me alone, and
I’ll let you alone.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! He’s writing verse!” cried Tom.
“Well, if that isn’t the limit, fellows! Say, he
has got ’em bad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me tired!” snapped Sid, as he
stuffed the paper, over which he had been laboring,
into his pocket. “Can’t a fellow write a letter?
I’m going down in the reading room.”</p>

<p>And before they could stop him he had slipped
out.</p>

<p>“Sid certainly is going some,” remarked Phil.
“The germ is working. Well, I’m going to turn
in. I’m dead tired and I expect I’ll sleep like a
top.”</p>

<p>“Dutch wanted us to come to his room to-night,”
remarked Frank. “He’s got some feed.”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” spoke Tom. “I’m not going
to risk anything that Dutch will set up, when the
games are so near. He’d feed us on Welsh rabbit
and cocoanut macaroons if he had his way. Not
that he wouldn’t eat ’em himself, but they don’t
go with training diet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m out of it, so I’ll take a chance,”
remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“Don’t take Sid,” Tom called after the big
Californian. “He’s on training diet, too. Dutch
has the digestion of an ostrich, and it won’t hurt
him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Frank retorted, and then Tom,
together with Phil, prepared to turn in.</p>

<p>Tom was thinking of many things. Of his
father’s troubles, of the possible outcome of the
contests, and of his own chances. For the first
time since he had begun to train extra hard, because
of the necessity of taking Shambler’s place,
Tom felt a little less “up to the mark” than usual.
He was more tired than he had been in several
weeks, and his stomach did not feel just right.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t overtrain,” he thought. “I can’t
afford to go stale.”</p>

<p>He did not know what time it was when he
awoke, but it must have been quite late, for Sid
and Frank had been in some time. The unpleasant
feeling in Tom’s stomach had increased,
and he did not know whether it was hunger or indigestion.</p>

<p>“Guess I worked a little bit too hard to-day,”
he reflected. “I’ll be all right in the morning.”</p>

<p>But he could not get to sleep again. He tossed
restlessly on his pillow, first trying one side of the
bed, and then the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hang it all, what’s the matter with me?” he
asked himself. “Guess I’ll get up and take a
drink of water.”</p>

<p>He moved quietly, so as not to disturb any of
his chums, but Sid, who was a light sleeper, heard
him.</p>

<p>“Who’s that? What’s the matter?” demanded
Tom’s team-mate.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just woke up&mdash;can’t seem to get to
sleep again. I don’t feel very good,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“Take some of that medicine the girls sent,”
advised Sid. “It’s a harmless enough tonic, and
it may do you good&mdash;send you to sleep. You
don’t want to get knocked out of your rest.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” agreed Tom. There was light
enough coming in through the transom over the
door to the hall, to enable him to see the bottle of
medicine on the shelf. He drew the cork, poured
out a dose and swallowed it with a little water.
The taste was not very pleasant, but he did not
mind that.</p>

<p>“Count sheep jumping over a stone fence, and
you’ll drop off in no time,” advised Sid, as Tom
went back to bed. Sid was soon slumbering again.</p>

<p>But, somehow or other, neither the counting
of sheep nor any of the other time-honored
methods of wooing Morpheus availed Tom. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
restlessness increased, and he was aware of a
growing distress in his stomach.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp pain wrenched him, and, in
spite of himself, he cried out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” faltered Tom. “I’m sick,
I guess. Oh, say, this is fierce!” he cried, as
another spasm racked him.</p>

<p>Phil was out of bed at once, and switched on
the light. One look at Tom was enough for him.</p>

<p>“Boy, you’re sick!” he declared. “I’m going
to call the doctor. You need looking after!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I’ll be all right in a little while.
I took some of that new medicine, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Another spasm of pain prevented Tom from
continuing, and hastened Phil’s decision. He
slipped on some garments, awakened Sid and
Frank, and was soon communicating with Proctor
Zane, who at once summoned Dr. Marshall, the
physician connected with Randall.</p>

<p>The medical man came in at once, stopping
only to slip on a bathrobe.</p>

<p>“What have you been eating&mdash;or taking?” he
demanded of Tom, as he felt of the youth’s pulse,
and examined him.</p>

<p>“Nothing but some of that Smith, Brown &amp;
Robinson’s Tonic,” groaned Tom, motioning toward
the medicine bottle. Sid quickly explained
about it, handing the phial to the physician. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
latter smelled of the mixture, tasted it gingerly
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“No wonder you’re sick, if you took that
stuff!”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve often taken it,” asserted Sid. “It
did me good.”</p>

<p>“Not ‘doped’ as this is,” declared Dr. Marshall.
“I know this preparation. It is very good,
but this has been tampered with. There’s enough
‘dope’ in there to make a score of you boys sick.
Throw the stuff away, or, no, hold on, let me have
it. I’ll look into this. There’s been underhand
work somewhere. You say some girl friends
sent it to you?”</p>

<p>“We thought so,” spoke Sid, “but if it’s been
meddled with, of course, they didn’t. I begin to
suspect something now.”</p>

<p>“Well, talk about it later,” advised the doctor
crisply. “I’ve got a sick lad to look after now.
Some of you get me a lot of hot water. I’ve got
to use a stomach pump,” and he mixed Tom some
medicine, while Sid hurried to rouse the housekeeper.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>JUST A CHANCE</small></h2>


<p>“Who you suppose could have sent that
stuff?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to look into it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we ought to tell Dr. Churchill, and have
him help us.”</p>

<p>Phil, Sid and Frank thus expressed themselves
in whispers, as they sat in their room. Tom had
been moved to the infirmary, and Dr. Marshall
was working over him with the assistance of
Professor Langley, who, as physics instructor,
knew something of medicine.</p>

<p>The three chums had just received word that
Tom was practically out of danger, and would
be all right in a day or so, but that he was still
quite ill, and suffered much discomfort.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how you fellows feel
about it,” spoke Sid, “but I’ve got my own opinion
as to how that stuff came to be fixed, so as to
make Tom ill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“How?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;” began Phil.</p>

<p>“I mean Shambler, and I don’t care who knows
it,” went on Sid, raising his voice. “He’s a cad&mdash;and
he’ll never be anything else. He and Tom
were on the outs from the first, partly over Miss
Tyler, and for other reasons.</p>

<p>“Then came the charge against Shambler, and,
though Tom had nothing to do with that, Shambler
has probably heard that Tom has taken his
place for the mile run. He hates Randall, and he
wants to see her lose after what happened to him,
and, he wants to make Tom, by slumping, bring
it about. That’s why he tried to ‘dope’ him.
Oh, if I had Shambler here!” and Sid clenched
his fists with fierce energy.</p>

<p>“Do you really think Shambler did it?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it!” declared Sid. “He is the
only one who would have an object.”</p>

<p>“What about Exter&mdash;or some of our enemies
from Boxer Hall&mdash;or even Fairview?” asked
Phil. “You know the bottle came from Fairview.”</p>

<p>“It might have come from there, but no one
from Fairview Institute sent it,” declared Sid
confidently. “I’m going to look into this.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to keep it quiet,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Frank. “I don’t see that any good can come of
raising a row about it.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” agreed Phil. “Let’s work it out
ourselves, with Dr. Marshall to help us.”</p>

<p>Sid finally agreed with this view. The night
wore on, and Tom, by energetic measures, was
soon brought out of danger. In fact he never
really was in what could be called “danger,” the
only effect of the stuff that had been put in the
tonic, Dr. Marshall said, being to make him ill
and weak. This, in all likelihood, was the object
of the person who had fixed the dose. He hoped
that Tom would be incapacitated for a week or
more.</p>

<p>For it developed that the original bottle, of
what was a standard remedy, had been opened,
and a certain chemical oil added, that would neutralize
the good effects, and make the stuff positively
harmful.</p>

<p>“Say, but it was a scare all right, though,”
remarked Sid, as the three sat talking about it,
too engrossed to go to bed. And, in their case
the usual rule of “lights out,” was not enforced
on this occasion. “I sort of think it was ‘up to
me,’ for recommending Tom to take the stuff.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” exclaimed Phil. “You meant all
right. It was that cad Shambler who ought to be
pummeled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’ll be hard to fix it on him,” was Frank’s
opinion; and so it proved.</p>

<p>The next morning the three friends arranged
with Dr. Marshall and the college authorities to
keep the real reason of Tom’s illness secret from
the students. It was given out that he was overtired
from training. Then they set to work to
unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>But it was hard work. In the first place they
learned that the girls at Fairview knew nothing
about the matter. Then Wallops was interviewed.</p>

<p>He gave a good description of the boy who had
brought the bottle, and this personage developed,
later, into a young employee of a local express
company. The boy was sought out.</p>

<p>All that he knew was that the bottle had been
given him at the Fairview office to take to Randall,
and at the office a clerk had only a dim recollection
of the person who brought it in to be dispatched.</p>

<p>Shambler was described to him, and he said
that youth might have been the one. But it was
flimsy evidence, and though Phil and his chums
were well enough satisfied in their own minds that
Shambler was the guilty one, there was no way
of proving it.</p>

<p>So the matter was dropped, as much “for the
honor of Randall,” as for any other reason. For,
as Phil said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fellows, we don’t want it to get out that any
lad who once attended here could be guilty of such
a thing.”</p>

<p>And so the affair rested.</p>

<p>It was two days before Tom was on his feet
again, and though he had a wretched time he was,
in a measure, even better off than before he took
the unfortunate dose. For the rest had done him
good, and when he got back to practice, rather
pale and uncertain, he soon picked up his speed.</p>

<p>Sid, meanwhile, had been doing hard work, and
the other candidates were up to the difficult standard
set by Holly and Kindlings.</p>

<p>It was two days before the postponed games.
All the difficulties caused by the change of date
had been overcome, and there was every prospect
of a successful meet.</p>

<p>“Now, Tom, do you feel like letting yourself
go?” asked Holly, as the pitcher came out for
a trial on the track.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m all right again,” was the answer.
“In fact I think I’m better than I was. Shall I
do the whole distance?”</p>

<p>“No, try a half at first. Then, after you warm
up, go the limit. We’ll ‘clock’ you.”</p>

<p>As Tom sped over the cinder track for the half
mile run, he felt within himself a confidence that
he had not been conscious of before.</p>

<p>“I believe that fit of sickness did me good,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he reflected. “It rested me up, at any rate.”
When he had come to the finish mark, and the
time was announced, it was two seconds better
than he had ever done before.</p>

<p>“Now for the mile,” suggested Kindlings.
“But take a little rest.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go at something else,” decided Tom.
“I don’t want to get stiff.” So he did a little work
at putting the shot, jumped over a few hurdles,
tried some high and broad leaping, and then announced
that he was ready for the mile test.</p>

<p>Quite a throng gathered about the track to
watch Tom at his practice, and he felt not a little
nervousness as he got on his mark.</p>

<p>“Go,” shouted Kindlings, as he fired the
pistol, and Tom was off with some of the other
candidates, who were in more to fill up, and make
a showing for Randall than because they, or
their friends, hoped they would win. And yet
there was always the one chance.</p>

<p>Tom got off in good shape on the half mile
track, two circuits of which were necessary to
make the required distance.</p>

<p>“He certainly can go,” observed Holly Cross,
who, with Kindlings, and some other kindred
spirits, was watching the test.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on!” yelled Bean Perkins,
who was getting his voice in shape for the strain
that would be put on it when the games were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
called. “Oh you, Tom Parsons! Come on!”</p>

<p>And Tom came. Running freely and well, he
covered yard after yard, doing the half just a
shade better than his other performance.</p>

<p>“Now for the real test,” murmured Kindlings,
as our hero swung around the track on the final
lap.</p>

<p>There were many eager faces lining the rail,
and hands that held stop watches trembled a bit.
On and on ran Tom, until he breasted the tape
at the finish.</p>

<p>“Time! Time! What’s the time?” shouted
the eager students who knew that fifths of seconds
counted in a championship meet.</p>

<p>“Four minutes, forty-one and two-fifth seconds,”
announced Holly. “Tom, that’s the best
yet!”</p>

<p>“We’ll win! We’ll win!” screamed Bean.
“Come on, boys!” he called to his crowd of
shouters, “let’s practice that new song, ‘We’ll
cross the line a winner, or we’ll never cross at all.’
All on the job, now.”</p>

<p>“Tom, old man, you’re all right,” cried Phil,
as his chum slipped a sweater over his shoulders.
“You’re going to win!”</p>

<p>“I hope&mdash;so,” was the panting answer.</p>

<p>There was a comparison of records, and it was
found that while Tom’s was a little behind some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
mile run performances, it was better than that of
a number of former champions.</p>

<p>“I think he can cut down a second or two when
the games are run off,” said Kindlings, discussing
the matter with Holly. “There’ll be a band then,
and that always helps a lot, and big crowds, to
say nothing of Bean and his shouters.”</p>

<p>“And the girls,” added wise Holly. “Tom’s
got a girl in Fairview, I understand, and if she’s
on hand he’ll run his head off.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to have her on hand, if we’ve
got to bribe her,” declared Kindlings.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess she won’t need any bribing,” went
on his chum. “Now let’s see what Sid can do.”</p>

<p>Sid, on whom the hopes of Randall rested to
win the broad jump, was on his mettle. He could
easily cover twenty feet, without straining himself,
and to-day, in what all regarded as among the last
of the important practices, he had several times,
gone an inch or two over.</p>

<p>“I don’t hope to equal Bowers who, in 1899,
did twenty-one feet, eight and one-half inches,”
said Sid, “but I do want to do twenty foot, six,
and I’m going to make it, too.”</p>

<p>“Sheran, in 1909, only made twenty feet, seven
and a half inches,” Phil reminded his chum.</p>

<p>“Don’t make me envious,” begged Sid. “If
I do twenty feet, six, I’ll be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be satisfied with anything but the limit,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
suggested Kindlings. But then he always was a
hard trainer.</p>

<p>And so the practice went on, until Holly and
Kindlings, seeing the danger of weariness, called
a halt.</p>

<p>“I think we’re coming on all right,” was Holly’s
opinion as he and his fellow coach left the field.
“I’d like to get a line, though, on what Boxer
Hall and the others are doing.”</p>

<p>“So would I, and I believe we ought to. Is
there anything in the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a lot of surmises, and some stuff that I
believe is faked on purpose to deceive us.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see if we can get a line on their
form.”</p>

<p>Accordingly certain “spies” were sent out to
see if they could get any information. It was regarded
as legitimate then, for no underhand
methods were used. It was “all in the game,”
and there was a sort of friendly rivalry among
the colleges.</p>

<p>A day later some of the lads whom Kindlings
had sent out made a report. On the receipt of it
the young coach did some figuring on the back of
an envelope. Holly came upon him engaged in
this occupation.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m trying to ‘dope out,’ where we
stand,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got any line?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I can depend on it. The way I figure
out is this. We’ve fairly got ’em all on some
things. But not the mile run and the broad jump.
Of course something might go wrong with the
dash, or the hammer and weight throws, but I
don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the run and jump?”</p>

<p>“Well, if these figures from Exter are true,
they’ve got Tom by about three seconds, and Sid
by two inches. But I think Exter has been too
optimistic in giving the ‘dope.’”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve gone under their records to
get better odds in betting.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. The only one I’m really
afraid of is Exter. I think we can clean up Boxer
Hall and Fairview. They can’t come near us on
anything except the weight throw and pole vault,
and I know Phil will make good on the vault, and
if Dutch doesn’t get the fifty-six over the twenty-five
foot mark I’ll punch his head.”</p>

<p>“Then the way you figure it out, we’ve got our
work cut out for us?”</p>

<p>“We always had, but I think now that we’ve
got just a chance to win. A chance, and nothing
more, for the championship. If Shambler and
Frank had stayed in it would have been different,
but as it is, and not to disparage Tom or Sid,
we’ve got a fair chance and nothing more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“To quote the raven,” said Holly with a smile.
“‘Nevermore,’ Mr. Poe. But I think we’ll do
it, Kindlings.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” was the grave answer.
“I hope so.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />
<small>AT THE GAMES</small></h2>


<p>It was a day to be proud of&mdash;a day when nature
was at her best. The sun shone, the sky was
cloudless, the grass was green, and there was just
enough wind to make it cool, without endangering
any such delicate operation as putting a fifty-six
pound weight, or interfere with an athlete hurling
himself over the crossbar in the pole vault.</p>

<p>“Say, things couldn’t be better!” cried Tom,
as he jumped out of bed, and stood at the open
window, breathing in the balmy air. “It’s a good
thing Randall’s luck postponed the games a week.”</p>

<p>“Feeling fit?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“As a fiddle. Say, old man, I wish you were
with us,” and Tom put his arm around the Big
Californian.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’ll win without me, and maybe
I’ll be with you&mdash;next time,” replied Frank,
with the semblance of a laugh. None but himself
knew the bitterness of his heart, and how much
of a strain it had been for him to step aside, “for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the honor of Randall,” when he was sure, in his
own mind, that he was in the right, and that not
a blot of professionalism stained his record.</p>

<p>“Come on, Sid,” urged Tom, as he pulled the
blankets off his still slumbering chum. “As the
old school readers used to say: ‘The sun is up, and
we are up, too.’ Tumble out, and get your lungs
full of good air. Then we’ll have a bit of breakfast
and do some practice.”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Sid, and he rolled out.</p>

<p>All was astir at Randall, and so, too, in the
other colleges. For, though the games did not
take place until afternoon, there was much yet to
do, many final arrangements to make, and the
candidates, nervous as young colts, wanted a last
try-out.</p>

<p>Running and jumping shoes had to be looked
after, tights and shirts in which were rents, or
from which buttons were missing, were being repaired
by the rough and ready surgery of the college
lads.</p>

<p>“This is the time when I wish we were at Fairview,”
remarked Tom, as he gingerly handled a
needle, repairing a tear in his shirt.</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Sid.</p>

<p>“So I could ask some of the girls to fix these
rips. I never can get used to a thimble.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Phil. “I shove it through
with a nail file.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Threading a needle gets my goat,” confessed
Sid. “Some authorities say to hold the thread
still, and shove the needle at it. Other text
books claim that the only proper way is to stick
the needle upright in your knee and, after shutting
your eyes, keep poking the thread at it until you
make a hit. Then knot it and proceed as directed.”</p>

<p>“I never can get the right kind of a point on
the thread,” admitted Frank. “It’s always too
long, and then it curls up, and shoots around the
needle like a drop curve, or else it’s too short, and
blunt, and breaks the eye out of the needle.”</p>

<p>“There’s some kind of a thimble, that you
stick your needle in, and it has a funnel so you
can sort of drop your thread through it, and get
it in the hole sooner or later,” remarked Tom.
“Guess I’ll get one.”</p>

<p>“I had one of ’em,” said Sid. “The trouble
is that after you get the needle in the thimble you
can’t get it out again, and you have to break it
off. Then you have to hunt up a new needle.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder some fellow doesn’t invent a
kind of court plaster that you could stick over a
tear, and mend it that way, as we do a cut,” suggested
Phil. “I think I’ll work on that, instead
of my perpetual motion machine after the games.”</p>

<p>Thus the jolly talk went on, until the lads, being
excused from chapel for that day, had gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their athletic suits into some sort of shape, and
had gone out on the field for a final practice.</p>

<p>“Well, I trust the eleven will give a good account
of itself to-day,” mildly remarked Dr.
Churchill, as he met Holly and Kindlings with a
squad of candidates. The doctor knew rather less
about athletics than some girls do of baseball.</p>

<p>“It isn’t football, to-day, Doctor,” said Holly
gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. I ought to know that. Football
comes in the Fall. The nine plays for the
championship to-day, does it not? Ah, yes, I
hope you win both halves.”</p>

<p>“It’s the track team that’s going to compete&mdash;for
the all-around championship,” whispered Dr.
Marshall, with a wink at the young trainers.
“The track team, Dr. Churchill.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. I should have remembered. Well,
I’m sure they will win,” and, with this cheering
remark, the head of Randall passed on, thinking
of a new book on the history of Sanskrit that he
contemplated writing.</p>

<p>Out from their rooms, or the gymnasium,
poured the athletes, eager as young colts, and as
confident as all young lads are. Tom Parsons
was fully himself again, Dr. Marshall’s treatment
having put him on his feet. All efforts to learn
more about the “doped” bottle of medicine had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
been dropped, and very few in the college even
knew about it.</p>

<p>Sid, too, was trained to the minute, and the
others, on whom Randall based her hopes, gave
every promise of making good. Yet there was
always the chance of a “fluke,” and Holly and
Kindlings were desperately nervous as they
checked record after record, cast up table after
table of points, trying to figure out a more sure
system for Randall to win.</p>

<p>The last of the practice was over. The boys
had done all that was humanly possible to warrant
their success. Now it all depended on the final
outcome.</p>

<p>The athletes were to go to Tonoka Lake Park
in autos, which had been supplied by some of the
wealthier students of Randall. The rank and file
would go in trolley cars, or any other way that
suited them.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t do any more,” remarked
Holly to Kindlings, as they stood together, ready
to start for the field. “We’ve done our best, and
the rest lies with our lads.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll make good, all right; don’t
worry,” spoke Kindlings confidently. “Bean Perkins
has a lot of new songs to cheer ’em with, and
then with the band playing, our colors flying, the
crowd yelling, and the girls looking pretty, why,
we can’t lose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cross your fingers,” murmured Holly superstitiously,
with a short laugh. “Cross your fingers,
Dan, old man.”</p>

<p>“All up!” sung out Dutch Housenlager, as the
autos came rolling up to the gymnasium. “All
up, fellows. It’s do or die, now.”</p>

<p>“All ready!” yelled Bean Perkins. “A last
cheer before we meet ’em at the grounds, fellows.”</p>

<p>The cheer came with resounding energy, and
when it had died away, some one called for
“<i>Aut Vincere, Aut Mori!</i>” “Either We Conquer,
or we Die!”</p>

<p>The sweetly solemn strains of the Latin song
rang out over the campus, as the competing team
rolled away in the autos, waving their hands at
their fellows.</p>

<p>“Hang it all, it seems like a funeral!” murmured
Sid.</p>

<p>“Cut that out, you heathen!” ordered Phil,
thumping his chum on the back.</p>

<p>“Feeling nervous?” asked Frank of Tom, to
whom he sat next in the big car, for, though the
Big Californian was not to compete, he rode with
his chums.</p>

<p>“Just a little. I’m always thinking that I’ll
slip, or&mdash;something&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let the other fellow do the worrying,” suggested
Frank, and it was good advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not a long ride to Tonoka Park, and
when the autos containing the athletes came in
sight of it, the lads saw the grounds gay in colors,
while a big throng was already on hand. The
strains of a band could be heard, and there were
cheers and songs, for the crowds from Boxer
Hall and Fairview were already in evidence.</p>

<p>“My! There’s a mob!” remarked Tom, as
they swung up to the part of the field set apart
for them.</p>

<p>“And look at the girls!” added Phil, as he
waved his hand toward a section of the grandstand
where the maids of Fairview were gathered.</p>

<p>“Will we have time to see ’em before we
dress?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll make it, whether you have or not,”
retorted Frank. “You’re getting it bad.”</p>

<p>“Dry up!” ordered Sid sententiously.</p>

<p>They left their suit cases in the dressing rooms
assigned to them, and started across the field toward
the stand where they hoped to see Ruth
Clinton and her chums.</p>

<p>As they walked along Tom started, and stared
toward a section of the crowd.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought I saw Shambler,” spoke Tom in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He wouldn’t dare show his face
here,” said Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess not,” agreed Tom, and he dismissed
the matter.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” cried Ruth, as she spied her
brother and his friends. “And we haven’t got
your colors, either.”</p>

<p>She shook a flag of Fairview in his face.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” replied Phil. “Enough other girls
have ’em,” and he waved his hand toward a part
of the stand where the young lady cohorts of
Randall sported the yellow and maroon.</p>

<p>Tom greeted Madge Tyler, and, as he stood
beside her, he caught a glimpse of something yellow
beneath the lapel of her light cloak.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell,” she whispered, “or I’d be tried
for treason, but&mdash;I just couldn’t help it,” and,
with a cautious glance around, she showed him a
tiny bow of Randall’s colors, under those of her
own college. “I&mdash;I just hope you’ll win!” she
whispered, and Tom pressed her hand as he murmured
his thanks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</small></h2>


<p>“Here comes the Exter bunch!” was a sudden
cry.</p>

<p>There was the shrill, staccato tooting of a
“yard of tin,” on the big tally-ho coach that
carried the athletes, their manager and trainers.
Gaily bedecked in ribbons it was, and behind
came several other vehicles, autos and coaches
mingling, carrying the crowd of Exter collegians,
who sent cheer after cheer ringing across the
grounds of the park.</p>

<p>“They’re coming in style,” remarked Miss
Harrison.</p>

<p>“Wait until you see them go away,” murmured
Phil. “They won’t cheer then.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too certain,” cautioned Miss Newton.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” went on Phil. “We’re
going to win. I feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p>“Look at those boys!” interrupted Miss Tyler.
“Those Exter chaps I mean. They’re waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
right at us, girls! And we haven’t met any of
them. The audacity!”</p>

<p>“Can’t blame them much, for picking out the
prettiest crowd of girls here,” ventured Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” chorused the four.</p>

<p>“Humph! Those Exterites have their nerve
with them all right,” commented Phil. “I hope
we take ’em down a peg.”</p>

<p>“Say, if you fellows are going to take part in
the games to-day, get a move on!” cried Holly
Cross, running up at that juncture. “You want
to warm up before the events. Come on! the
girls will manage to live without you for a while,
I guess, and you can come back later with colors
flying.”</p>

<p>He bowed and smiled at the pretty quartette,
and then Tom and his chums, once more predicting
that they were going to carry the colors of
Randall to the fore, hurried away.</p>

<p>The Exter crowd, after cheering for their three
opponents, who, in turn, cheered the latest arrivals,
took their place in the grandstand reserved
for them. The contestants hurried in to get on
their togs, which example was followed by our
friends.</p>

<p>“Look well to your shoe lacings,” advised
Holly to his crowd of athletes. “Don’t have anything
slipping at the last minute. Has everybody
got everything he needs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>At once there were cries for various things,
from bottles of liniment, or witch hazel, to strips
of adhesive plaster, or wrist straps.</p>

<p>“Say! I never saw such a bunch of babies!”
complained Kindlings. “You’d forget your heads
if they weren’t fast.”</p>

<p>He hurried here and there, looking after the
lads as if they were children, unable to do anything
for themselves. And, with all this, Kindlings
himself expected to take part in several
events, and he had grimly made up his mind to
win some of them, at least.</p>

<p>“There goes the Boxer Hall crowd,” commented
Tom, looking from a window of the dressing
room, that gave a view of the field. “They’re
out for practice.”</p>

<p>“See anything of Langridge?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s there, and Gerhart, too. I’ve got
to run against him&mdash;Langridge I mean.”</p>

<p>“And Gerhart is in the broad jump, I hear,”
added Sid. “Well, don’t let that worry you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” replied Tom, as he completed his
preparations.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows, get a move on,” pleaded
Holly, and soon those who were going to fight
for the honor of Randall tumbled out of the
dressing rooms, and trotted across the track and
field.</p>

<p>“There they are, boys! There they are!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
yelled Bean Perkins, wildly waving a much-beribboned
cane at his crowd of shouters. “All together
now! Give ’em, ‘We’re going to beat the
three of you, and take your warlocks home!’”</p>

<p>The song was given with a will, and from then
on there was a pandemonium of sound, as the
shouting contingents of the various colleges sought
to put heart and courage into their representatives.</p>

<p>There was a final consultation of the arrangement
committee, the starters, timers, judges were
given their instructions, and the contestants were
told to get in readiness. There had been some
warm-up practice, and scores of eager lads were
but awaiting the crack of the pistol.</p>

<p>“Remember boys,” Holly impressed on the
Randallites. “We can’t expect to win every event,
but we’ve just got to get five out of the eight to
clinch the championship. We’ve already lost the
hurdle race, but if we get the mile run, the broad
jump, the pole vault, a hammer throw and one
other we can win, for they count the most. Get
more if you can, but remember, we need the five.”</p>

<p>Wallace, the Exter manager, passed by, nodding
to Holly and the others.</p>

<p>“Everything all right?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Holly heartily.</p>

<p>“No bad feelings, I hope, on account of our
protest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a bit. We’re going to win anyhow; so
what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like feeling confident,” commented
Wallace, with a laugh. “Sorry I can’t wish you
luck, but we need this championship ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Come on now,” ordered Kindlings, bustling
up. “The fifty-six pound weight throwing comes
first. On the job, Dutch. I hope you beat me,
and the same to you Barth.” George Barth had
been substituted, some time back, for Bean Perkins,
who said he would be of more service to
Randall cheering for her, than competing in the
weight-throwing contest.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll win all right,” asserted Dutch
Housenlager, with an air of easy confidence, at
which Kindlings shook his head.</p>

<p>There was a silence while the announcer made
the statement about the opening event, and then,
as the various contestants came forward, there
were cheers for the representatives of each college.</p>

<p>“Everybody ready?” asked the judge, as he
glanced at the twelve contestants lined up before
him, for each college had entered three in the
fifty-six event.</p>

<p>There were nods of assent, and then a coin was
flipped to determine the order of succession. It
fell to the lot of Fairview to go first, with Boxer
Hall following, then Exter and finally Randall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Kindlings was glad of this, for he regarded it as
an advantage for his lads to try to beat the records
previously made by their opponents.</p>

<p>The Fairview lads stepped forward. They
were husky, clean-cut young fellows, and as the
first one took his place in the white, seven-foot
circle there was a little murmur of applause.</p>

<p>He grasped the weight confidently, and soon
had it swinging well. He let go with a puff of
exertion, and watched anxiously as the distance
was measured.</p>

<p>“Eighteen feet four inches,” was the announcement.</p>

<p>“We’re safe so far,” murmured Kindlings for
he knew what Dutch could do. In quick succession
the others of Fairview heaved the big ball
with its triangular handle. The record of the
first lad was somewhat bettered, but it was soon
seen that Fairview could not hope to win, for the
distances the other contestants had done in practice
were fairly well known.</p>

<p>Boxer Hall bettered Fairview in this contest,
her best man’s distance being twenty-one feet,
five and a half inches.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go some to beat that,” murmured
Dutch.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can do it,” declared Kindlings, hoping
to put heart into the big lad.</p>

<p>Now came Exter’s turn, and with confidence her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
first contestant took his place. He equalled but
did not beat Boxer Hall, and the second man fell
below. Then came the third.</p>

<p>The lad on whom the hopes of Exter now depended
was a magnificent specimen. Tall and
fair, a very picture of an athlete, he stooped over
and grasped the handle of the weight. There
was a smile on his lips, and he seemed to look at
Dutch as though challenging him individually.</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like, old man,” murmured
the Randall representative. “I’ll catch you.”</p>

<p>There was a gasp of astonishment as the
weight sailed away&mdash;astonishment and admiration
mingled for, it was easily seen that this throw was,
so far, the record-breaker.</p>

<p>“Wow!” gasped Kindlings as the weight
landed. “Look out for yourself, Dutch.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight feet, eight inches!” sung out the
score keeper. It was a good throw, not equaling
the best of the amateur records by a foot, but still
very fair.</p>

<p>“Now, Dutch, it’s up to us,” said Kindlings in
a low voice. “I’ll go first, Barth will follow, and
you hold yourself for the last. Remember we’ve
<em>got</em> to win!”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Dutch, as Kindlings stepped
into the circle.</p>

<p>He did not beat the Exter player’s throw, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
fact being three feet behind it, and Barth was
but little better.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dutch!” ordered Kindlings, and
then from the grandstand came one of Randall’s
songs chorused by Bean Perkins and his throng.</p>

<p>There was a hush as Dutch took up the weight,
and as the muscles of his legs swelled out during
the preliminary swinging of it, it seemed as if he
might win, for he was in perfect trim.</p>

<p>Over his head sailed the weight, to fall with
a thud on the turf&mdash;a thud that seemed loud amid
the hush that followed.</p>

<p>There were anxious faces watching the scorer
as he and his assistants measured the distance,
for everything now depended on this record Dutch
had made.</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight feet,” sung out the official, and
Dutch felt his heart sink. “And five inches,”
added the scorer. “The weight throwing contest
goes to Exter by three inches, with Randall
second.”</p>

<p>There was a riot of cheers from the Exter
grandstand, and gloom and silence on the part of
Randall. She had lost the first event.</p>

<p>“He beat me by three inches&mdash;three inches,”
murmured Dutch, as if he could not understand it.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Kindlings. “You did
ten inches better than you ever did in practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Dutch. It was a great throw, and&mdash;Oh, well,
we’ve got a chance yet.”</p>

<p>The preparations for the throwing of the sixteen
pound hammer were now underway. The
Jersey twins, Pete Backus, and Holly were entered
in this, and as they had all done well in practice
the hopes of Randall ran high.</p>

<p>“Beat ’em, boys, beat ’em!” called Tom Parsons,
as the quartette went forward to meet their
opponents. At that moment Wallops, who, with
some of the other Randall messengers, was on
the ground approached Tom.</p>

<p>“Your father is looking for you, Mr. Parsons,”
he said.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;my father?” gasped Tom. “What do
you mean? Is he here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he just arrived. He’s over talking to
Dr. Churchill, and the doctor sent me to find you.
Your father wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“Wants to see me,” faltered Tom. There
could be but one meaning to the unexpected visit,
he thought. He must leave Randall.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br />
<small>TOM’S RUN</small></h2>


<p>“All right, Wallops, tell him I’ll be right
over,” said Tom. “I’ll tell Kindlings where I’m
going, so he won’t be looking for me. But I’ve
got plenty of time before it’s my turn.”</p>

<p>He slipped on a heavy bathrobe, for, in his
abbreviated running costume, he was not exactly
in shape to go to the grandstand.</p>

<p>“The lawsuit must have gone against dad, or
else he’s come to have me go back and testify,”
reasoned Tom. “If he’s lost the case, it’s good-bye
to Randall for me. But if he wants me to
go to court, I’m going to ask him to wait until
after the run. I’m not going to desert now. The
case will have to wait. But I wonder why dad
came, instead of telegraphing? It must be important.
I hope nothing else can have happened.”</p>

<p>Anxious thoughts came to Tom, as he made his
way through the press of people. His mother or
sister might be ill. It was an inopportune time to
receive bad news&mdash;almost on the instant of entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a race that meant so much to Randall. But
Tom made up his mind to do his best under any
circumstances.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Frank, whom Tom passed
on his way to see his father.</p>

<p>“My dad’s here,” was the reply. “He came
unexpectedly. I don’t know what it means.”</p>

<p>Frank looked grave, for he knew on how slender
a thread hung Tom’s chances. A moment
later our hero saw his father waving his hand to
him from his place beside the president of Randall.
Dr. Churchill, and several members of the
faculty, had come to the games, though Professor
Emerson Tines refused to attend.</p>

<p>“Tom!” cried Mr. Parsons as he came down
an aisle to meet his son. “I’m glad to see you,
boy. You didn’t expect to find me here; did you?”</p>

<p>“No, dad. Is anything&mdash;anything wrong?”
Tom could hardly frame the question. But a look
at his father’s face told him that he need have
nothing to fear&mdash;at least for the present.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tom!” was the hearty answer.
“I have good news for you, and I thought I’d
come and tell you myself, instead of wiring. The
lawsuit is ended.”</p>

<p>“And you win?”</p>

<p>“I do. The other fellows simply backed down,
and decided not to contest the case further. They
hadn’t a leg to stand on, and they knew it. I won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
everything, got back all my money, with interest,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then I can stay on at Randall?” interrupted
Tom, eagerly.</p>

<p>“You sure can. And look here, Tom. I hear
your team lost the first event.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dad. They out-threw us.”</p>

<p>“Have you competed yet?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m in the mile run. It’s next to the
last event.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Tom, my boy,” and Mr.
Parsons leaned forward and whispered. “If you
don’t win that I’ll never speak to you again, and
I don’t think you’re too big even yet, for me to
take over my knee, as I did once in a while, years
ago. So you want to win that race!” and he
laughed and clapped his son on the back.</p>

<p>“Dad, I’m going to win!” was Tom’s answer,
given with shining eyes. “This good news will
give me second wind.”</p>

<p>“I rather hoped it would,” said Mr. Parsons.
“That’s why I came here on the first train I could
get. Go on now, and&mdash;win!”</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and started from the grandstand,
while his father again took his seat near Dr.
Churchill. The throwing of the sixteen pound
hammer had already started, with Exter leading
off. Her entrants did well, and so did those of
Boxer Hall, and then came the turn of Randall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go to it, Joe! Go to it!” yelled Bean Perkins,
as one of the Jersey twins stepped into the
circle. “Come on now, boys, give ’em the ‘hammer
and tongs,’ song.”</p>

<p>It rolled out splendidly as Joe Jackson threw.
Perhaps it added to his strength and skill, for
certainly his heave was not beaten that day. It
stands as a record yet in the Tonoka Lake League&mdash;one
hundred and twenty-two feet and ten inches&mdash;but
a short distance less than some of the best
amateur records.</p>

<p>“Randall wins!” came the announcement at
the close of this contest, and Kindlings remarked:</p>

<p>“One of the five!”</p>

<p>The putting of the sixteen pound shot contest
was closer than either of the two previous events.
It was a matter of inches to decide the winner,
and there was a claim of a foul on the part of
Exter against one of the Boxer Hall contestants
which caused a delay.</p>

<p>“Say, those fellows seem to do nothing but find
fault,” remarked Tom to Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re afraid they won’t get all that’s
coming to ’em, I guess.”</p>

<p>“They will if I have anything to say about it,”
commented Tom grimly. “But maybe they won’t
like it.”</p>

<p>The dispute was finally settled and the throwing
went on. To Dan’s chagrin, and the despair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Holly Cross, Randall lost this event by the narrow
margin of one inch. It went to Exter, and
there was a riot of cheers from her supporters.</p>

<p>But the pole vault turned the tables, and Phil
hurled himself over the bar in magnificent style,
clearing ten feet seven inches, and winning the contest.
And, as if that was not enough, Ned Warren,
another Randall lad, was but an inch below
this, he too beating the best performance of
either of the other three colleges.</p>

<p>“We win twice in this event,” said Holly, who
had tied the best man of Exter in the vault. “If
they’d only let us count it twice we’d be all right.”</p>

<p>“But we’re coming on,” declared Kindlings,
and, when the hundred yard dash also went to the
wearers of the maroon and yellow, Bean Perkins
could not contain himself.</p>

<p>“Cut loose, boys! Cut loose!” he ordered,
and the “Automobile chorus” was fairly howled
by the delighted cheerers.</p>

<p>“Three out of five events we need,” remarked
Holly, as he and Dan were busy figuring up the
points scored. “We may get the high jump, but
if we don’t, and Tom and Sid make good, we’ll
win the championship.”</p>

<p>“I hope we win the high,” said Dan. “Berry
Foster is in fine trim, and I don’t like cutting it
so fine as to leave the last two events to clinch
things. No telling what may happen to Sid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Tom, though they’re both feeling fit as fiddles they
say. Oh, if we can only get the high!”</p>

<p>“Don’t want everything,” suggested Holly with
a laugh. “There they go for it. Come on over
and watch.”</p>

<p>Randall’s lads made a gallant attempt to bring
home the high jump, but it was not to be, and
Boxer Hall carried off the coveted trophy, while
her sons sang and cheered themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>There were but two more events on the program&mdash;the
mile run and the running broad jump.
Randall needed both of these to win, for, should
Exter annex one, and either of the other colleges
the other it would mean that the championship
would be lost to the wearers of the maroon and
yellow.</p>

<p>“Now Tom, it’s up to you,” said Dan in a low
voice as the runners came out on their marks.
“Are you all right&mdash;feel nervous or anything?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not nervous. I want to win, Dan,
but if I don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It won’t be from lack of trying,” was the
reply. “Go on Tom, they’re waiting for you.”</p>

<p>But, in spite of the fact that Tom had said he
was not nervous there was an unusual thumping
of his heart. He tried to calm himself, but, the
more he did so, the worse he seemed to get.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it! This won’t do!” he mused.
“If Frank was running this race, he wouldn’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
like this. I must think that I’m doing this for
him. Brace up! Even Shambler wouldn’t flunk.”</p>

<p>Tom felt better after that little lecture to himself
by himself, and when he glanced across toward
the grandstands, and saw a slim girlish figure
suddenly spring up, and wave his colors at him,
he felt a surge of elation and delight.</p>

<p>“That’s Madge!” whispered Tom to himself.
“I’m going to win! I’m going to win! For Randall
and&mdash;her!”</p>

<p>The runners were in their places. The starter
had raised his pistol. Tom, for the first time,
noticed that on his left was Langridge&mdash;his old
enemy. Langridge had seen Miss Tyler’s action,
and he smiled mockingly at our hero.</p>

<p>“I’m going to win!” Tom told himself over
and over again.</p>

<p>“On your marks!” cried the starter.</p>

<p>“They’re going to run!” said Ruth Clinton to
Madge, who sat next to her.</p>

<p>“I know it&mdash;I know it!” replied Madge nervously.
“Oh, I do hope he wins!”</p>

<p>“Who, Roger Barns?” asked Ruth. “Evidently
not though, since you waved the yellow and
maroon.”</p>

<p>“Of course not&mdash;you know who I mean,” and
Madge blushed.</p>

<p>Crack went the starter’s pistol, and the runners
were away on their course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re off!” yelled Bean Perkins. “Now
boys, the ‘Conquer or Die,’ song, and sing it as
you never sang it before. We want Tom to win,
and our other lads to get second and third.”</p>

<p>Our hero, running with all his might, heard the
sweet strains wafted to him across the track, and
he shut his lips grimly, and looked at Langridge
out of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>The track was a half mile one, two laps being
necessary to make the distance. As it was a big
wide one, enabling all the contestants to start at
once, there was no necessity for heats in this event.
It could thus be decided more quickly.</p>

<p>On and on raced Tom. He felt a responsibility
he had never experienced before, and it seemed
as if he carried the whole weight of Randall on
his shoulders, though Jerry and Joe Jackson were
in the event. Tom was running well, and he knew
he had a reserve of wind and strength for the
final spurt. The last few days of practice had
done much for him, and even his unfortunate illness
had not pulled him down.</p>

<p>It was evident, soon after the start of the race,
that it lay between Tom Parsons, Langridge of
Boxer Hall and Sam Wendell of Exter. That
was unless some of those who were strung out
behind them should develop unexpected speed.
And this was not likely.</p>

<p>A mile run is a matter of only seven minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
or thereabouts, at the worst, for any performance
slower than seven minutes and thirty-eight seconds
scores nothing under the A. A. U. rules. And so
the decision of the contest could not be long in
doubt.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the half mile Tom and
Langridge were on even terms. The foremost
Exter lad had fallen back a few feet, and Tom’s
only fear was lest this contestant might be saving
himself for a winning spurt.</p>

<p>“But I can spurt too!” thought our hero.
“I’m going to win! I’m going to win!”</p>

<p>On and on they raced. Nearer and nearer to
the goal they came. Breaths were coming faster
and faster. It became harder and harder to get
air into the laboring lungs. The weary muscles
needed more and more urging to make them do
their work.</p>

<p>“Can I do it? Can I do it?” Tom asked himself.</p>

<p>And the grim answer came.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to! I’ve got to!”</p>

<p>There was a mist before his eyes, and yet
through it he seemed to see a fair, girlish figure
waving a maroon and yellow flag at him. But the
colors were blurred.</p>

<p>A singing came into Tom’s ears. It sounded
like the beating of the waves of the sea. His
heart was a pump, working at double speed. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
legs were like the pistons of some engine, darting
back and forth. They did not seem to belong to
him, but to be separate from his body.</p>

<p>Once or twice he thought of looking down, to
make sure that they were fast to his trunk, but he
knew he must keep his eyes ahead of him, and his
head well up. Now and then he glanced across
to where Langridge was running. The Boxer
Hall lad was still in his place, even with Tom.
The foremost Exter runner was still lagging behind.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to shake him off&mdash;shake Langridge,”
thought Tom, and it seemed as if he was someone
else saying this.</p>

<p>The finish tape loomed in sight. The eager
judges and timekeepers crowded to the course.
Now was the time to spurt if ever.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom! Come on!” yelled scores of
encouraging voices, and once more Bean Perkins
and his cohorts sang a song of victory.</p>

<p>“Langridge! Langridge!” cried his mates,
and the Exter lad’s fellows shouted to him to win.</p>

<p>On and on raced Tom. It seemed as if he
could not keep it up. His legs were senseless&mdash;his
feet like lead&mdash;his breath was all but gone.</p>

<p>“But I must do it! I must&mdash;for the honor of
Randall!” he seemed to shout, yet no sound came
from between his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now!” yelled Holly Cross, who was watching
Tom. “Come!”</p>

<p>It was the signal to spurt, and Tom put out his
last ounce of strength in the leap forward. He
breasted the tape, and, as he crossed the line he
shot a hasty glance to either side.</p>

<p>He was alone! Langridge had faltered at the
last. The Exter man was a poor third.</p>

<p>Tom had won the mile run!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a><br />
<small>SID’S GREAT JUMP</small></h2>


<p>“Oh Tom!”</p>

<p>“Good old boy!”</p>

<p>“You did it! You did it!”</p>

<p>“I knew you would! Oh Tom!”</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be calling to him at once.
A score of arms sought to clasp Tom Parsons,
a double score of hands were shot out to pat him
on the back.</p>

<p>“Good old Tom!” cried Holly Cross, as he
ran up to help support the half-exhausted runner.</p>

<p>“You’ve done your share,” complimented
Kindlings.</p>

<p>A figure burst through the throng surrounding
the winner.</p>

<p>“Oh Tom!” a voice cried. “I knew you
could do it!” Frank Simpson clasped his chum
in his arms. There was not a trace of envy&mdash;only
the best of good fellowship.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought of you,” said Tom, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
breathing was less labored. “I&mdash;I ran for you,
Frank. I pretended it was your contest, and I
played it as well as I could.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been better,” declared the Big
Californian. “Now come on&mdash;the girls want to
see you,” for Frank had been sitting near Miss
Tyler and her friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait until I wash up,” protested Tom,
but Frank would not take “no” for an answer,
and, slipping a big robe around his chum he led
him away to receive the congratulations that
awaited him.</p>

<p>Tom’s father came down from the grandstand
to meet him.</p>

<p>“Oh boy!” he cried. “You did it! I’m going
to telegraph your mother!” And then, with
a hand clasp, he pressed his son to him, and hurried
on to wire the good news.</p>

<p>“The girls are waiting for you!” he called
back as he laughed, and Tom blushed.</p>

<p>“Congratulations!” exclaimed Madge Tyler,
as Tom climbed his way to her and the others.
He was being greeted on all sides by those on the
grandstand, but he had eyes for only one.</p>

<p>“I guess you were the mascot,” he whispered,
as he sat down in a place Miss Tyler made for
him. Tom clasped her hand.</p>

<p>“And our poor college isn’t in it,” said Ruth
Clinton sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a chance yet,” declared Mabel Harrison.</p>

<p>“Not with Sid Henderson to do the broad
jump,” asserted Tom confidently.</p>

<p>Madge Tyler hastily made a bow of yellow
and maroon and pinned it on one lapel of her
jacket, to balance the colors of her own college.</p>

<p>“You’re a traitor!” exclaimed Helen Newton.</p>

<p>“I am not. I’m only paying respect to the victor,”
said Madge with a laugh.</p>

<p>“We need the jump points; don’t we, Tom?”
asked Frank, as he managed to find a place near
the runner, who was the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>“We sure do. But I guess we can depend on
Sid.”</p>

<p>Preparations for the final event were going
forward. The games were almost over. But, so
close had been the contests, and so well distributed
were the points that even with all the hard work
on the part of her representatives, Randall could
not win unless she got the last event. Otherwise
there might be a tie between Boxer Hall and
Exter, that would have to be played off later, if
either got another first place.</p>

<p>The jumping contestants were out on the field.
They were receiving their last instructions, and
drawing for places. Sid got fifth chance.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the proceedings. The band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had rendered several airs, and the cheer leaders
and their cohorts were getting their voices in
shape for the final songs.</p>

<p>“All ready!” called the starter. “Come on
now, finish things up.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Sid?” asked Holly, as he
stood beside the lad on whom, as it had on Tom,
so much depended.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” was the confident answer. “I
don’t know what these other fellows are going
to do, but I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“We know that, Sid.”</p>

<p>Then the take-off was cleared, and the jumping
began.</p>

<p>There was not the sensationalism about the
running broad jump that there had been about
the mile run, but to a lover of games there was
much of interest in it. There were some good,
clean jumpers, too, and Randall’s lads were not a
whit behind their opponents.</p>

<p>In turn the representatives of Fairview and
Boxer Hall made their trials. There were two
of each, and Sid came fifth, the first one to try
for Randall.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to beat nineteen feet, eight inches,”
said Kindlings to his chum. “Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done nineteen, seven&mdash;that’s the best,”
was the low answer, “but I’ll try.”</p>

<p>Sid gathered himself for the run, and took-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
beautifully. He came down a good two inches
beyond the best previous mark, and there was a
shout of delight as this was noted.</p>

<p>“I claim a foul!” was the sudden remark of
an Exter player. “Henderson overstepped the
take-off mark.”</p>

<p>At once there was a storm of protest, and
some acquiescing voices. Holly and Kindlings insisted
that Sid had not fouled, and, after some
delay, and not a little disputing, in which hard
words were passed, it was agreed that Sid might
try again, after the last contestant.</p>

<p>The cheers that had sprung up when it was
rumored that Sid had won, were hushed, and in
tense silence the Randallites awaited the final
outcome.</p>

<p>An Exter lad had covered an even twenty feet,
and this was by far the best record for that event
in the league. Already Exter was cheering in
anticipation of victory. But Sid had another
chance.</p>

<p>“Can you do it?” asked Holly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s a big jump to beat, but
I’m just mad enough to do it. Of all the unfair
protests&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Get good and mad,” suggested
Holly. “They deserve to be beaten, and I believe
they will be. Jump as you never jumped
before, Sid!” and he clapped him on the back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>The course was cleared, and, amid a hush that
was almost unnatural Sid made his preparations.</p>

<p>On he came with a rush, rising beautifully into
the air as he reached the take off. This time
there was no question but what he had leaped
“cleanly.”</p>

<p><a href="#image01">Forward he hurled himself, straight through
the air</a>, like some animal, until he came down with
a thud. And, as he did so, he knew, in his own
heart, that he had jumped better than he had
ever jumped before.</p>

<p>A moment later came the confirmation.</p>

<p>“Twenty feet&mdash;two inches!” yelled the announcer.
“Sid Henderson wins&mdash;Randall wins
the championship&mdash;Randall wins!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a><br />
<small>RANDALL’S HONOR CLEARED</small></h2>


<p>“Come on boys! One last song!” begged Bean
Perkins of his well-nigh exhausted lads. “One
last song to celebrate the victory!”</p>

<p>They gave it with a will, followed by cheer
after cheer,&mdash;for the team, for the college, for
the colors, for their rivals, for the girls&mdash;anything
and everything was cheered.</p>

<p>Exter, Boxer Hall and Fairview nobly did their
share, too. They paid full tribute to their successful
rivals.</p>

<p>“And we win! We win! We win!” cried
Kindlings, as he capered about the group of tired
but happy athletes.</p>

<p>“As if there ever was a doubt,” said Holly
Cross.</p>

<p>“Oh, you get out!” protested Kindlings. “It
was all in the air until the last minute. Tom and
Sid pulled us out of the fire.”</p>

<p>The field was being overrun with spectators,
who sought to congratulate victors, or commiserate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
with the losers. Randall’s colors were seen
on every side, for, as is always the case in college
games, the winning hues always appear mysteriously
at the end of the contest.</p>

<p>“Come on, the girls are waiting for us,” said
Phil, who had changed into his ordinary garments.
“They want to congratulate you, Sid.”</p>

<p>“Then they’ll have to wait,” was the seeming
ungracious answer. “I’m all dust, and I’m going
to have a shower first. I’ll be with you in five
minutes.”</p>

<p>He raced away to the dressing rooms, and
Tom, Phil and Frank, who were “presentable”
now, went to talk to Madge and her chums.</p>

<p>“Well, how about it?” asked Tom, as he approached
them.</p>

<p>“We haven’t a word to say,” replied Miss Tyler.
“You won fairly and squarely, and&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You helped,” said Tom boldly. “You waved
our colors at the right time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as if she belonged to Randall, instead
of Fairview,” said Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>“She does, I guess,” said Ruth, with a glance
at Tom.</p>

<p>There was laughter, talking, quips and jibes,
but over all there was the spirit of gaiety.</p>

<p>“Your mother wired her congratulations,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Mr. Parsons, making his way to Tom. “I’m
going back home again now.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, dad,” insisted the winner of
the mile run. “You’re going to stay here to-night.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have the time of your life,” added Sid.
“Better stay.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I will,” agreed Mr. Parsons. “I
begin to feel like a boy again.”</p>

<p>Tom and his chums said farewell to their girl
friends, promising to call on them later. Then,
while still the cheers of Bean Perkins and his lads
were ringing over the field, faint but full of
spirit, the winning team started for Randall. Mr.
Parsons went with them.</p>

<p>And such a night as it was that followed.</p>

<p>Proctor Zane threw up his hands early in the
evening, and retired to his quarters. Dr. Churchill
said it was the best thing to do under the circumstances.
For the spirit of fun, of jollity, and of
victory was abroad in the land, and Randall celebrated
as she had never celebrated before.</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons was an honored guest, and he
proved himself to be imbued with the immortal
spirit of youth, for he was like a lad again, capering
about.</p>

<p>Bonfires were built, spreads innumerable were
held, professors were serenaded, and forced to
make congratulatory speeches. Even “Pitchfork,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
had to come out to speak to the team,
though he did not show very good grace. But
dear old Dr. Churchill struck the right note, and
was roundly cheered as he gracefully spoke of the
victory of the “track eleven and the baseball
racers.”</p>

<p>But he meant well.</p>

<p>And so that night at Randall passed into honored
and never-to-be-forgotten history.</p>

<p>They were in their room&mdash;the four inseparables.
It was a few days after the great games,
and the trophies indicating the championship of
Randall had been placed in an honored place in the
gymnasium. Also the tale of the victory had
gone abroad to the world.</p>

<p>Tom’s father had returned home, to tell the
details, the law case was a closed event. Now
came talk&mdash;talk of what had been.</p>

<p>“It was great&mdash;couldn’t have been better,” declared
Frank Simpson. “There is only one regret.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“About that charge against me. I don’t say
anything about Shambler, for he admitted his
guilt. But I know I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>

<p>“We’ll forget Shambler,” suggested Tom. “I
guess he’s vanished.”</p>

<p>“But I would like to have a ruling on my case,”
went on Frank. “I think it sort of stands as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
black mark against Randall. I don’t see why
that A. A. U. committee doesn’t answer.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. No one
seemed to know what to say. The alarm clock
ticked off the seconds. Tom was sprawled out
on the sofa, with Phil crowding him. In the armchairs
were Frank and Sid. There came a knock
on the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“A telegram for Mr. Simpson,” announced
Wallops.</p>

<p>The Big Californian leaped for the portal, and
swung it open. In an instant he had snatched
the yellow envelope, and torn it open. Rapidly
he scanned the message:</p>

<p>“Wow! Hurray!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s good news! This is a telegram from
the protest committee of the A. A. U. It says:
‘Your case, and others like it, ruled on some time
ago. Settled you were strictly amateurs. Letter
follows. You are eligible in all amateur contests.’
What do you think of that?” cried Frank,
capering about. “I knew I was right.”</p>

<p>“And so did we!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>The letter settled any last doubts. It came a
few days later, and stated that soon after the
charity games, in which Frank, and others, took
part, that the question of professionalism, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
account of the money prizes, had come up, and
had been settled in favor of the amateurs. No
hint, even, of professionalism tainted them, it
was said.</p>

<p>A copy of the ruling was at once sent to Exter
and the other colleges in the Tonoka League, and
Wallace replied at once, expressing his regret at
having raised the point, and congratulating Frank.</p>

<p>“But it’s all for the best,” declared Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tom, “for now there’s nothing
against the honor of Randall, since Shambler has
left.”</p>

<p>“And now there won’t be any question of your
playing baseball, football or rowing on the boat
crew&mdash;if we have one,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“Are we going to have a boat crew?” inquired
Tom.</p>

<p>“There’s talk of it,” was the answer.</p>

<p>And what Randall’s crew did may be learned
by reading the next book of this series, to be entitled
“The Eight-Oared Victors; A Story of
College Water Sports.” In that we will meet all
our old friends once more.</p>

<p>It was several days later. The celebrations of
Randall’s track and field victory were about over,
and the diamond was beginning to take on an unusually
active appearance.</p>

<p>One evening, in the room of the inseparables,
the four chums sat in silence, broken only by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
ticking of the clock, or the creak of the old sofa,
or easy chair.</p>

<p>Frank walked over to the table, and began
writing.</p>

<p>“It’s to a girl,” said Phil, in a low voice as he
heard the scratching of his friend’s pen.</p>

<p>“What of it?” snapped the big Californian.
“I guess you would write too if you wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” decided Phil, and soon four
pens were scratching.</p>

<p>“Well, for cats’ sake, what’s this?” demanded
Dutch Housenlager, a little later, as he came into
the room. “Is it a new literary club that I’ve
stacked up against?”</p>

<p>“Something like it,” remarked Tom, as he began
on his fourth page.</p>

<p>“Hey, what rhymes with dove?” asked Sid
dreamily.</p>

<p>“Love, you old moon-calf!” grunted Dutch,
as he backed out. “Say, when you fellows get
over being spoony, come out and have some fun,”
he added closing the door. And the scratching of
the four pens went on.</p>
